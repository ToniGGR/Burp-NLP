{"0": {"title": "Pilot", "text": "In the middle of the night, an obviously drunk Rick bursts into Morty's room and tells him he has a \"surprise\" to show him. While driving his newly built flying vehicle , Rick explains that he made a neutrino bomb : he has decided Earth needs a \"fresh start,\" and to that end, he wants to destroy humanity, planning to start over with Morty and Jessica as the new \"Adam and Eve.\" Morty tries to \"take control of the situation\" by taking the wheel of the vehicle. Rick eventually decides to land the vehicle, and when he does, he says it was all a test to get Morty to act more assertive. He passes out, and the bomb announces that it is armed and (presumably) activates.The next morning, Morty falls asleep at breakfast. His mother Beth is concerned, and Morty's older sister, Summer , explains that he was out with Grandpa Rick. This causes an argument between Jerry and his father-in-law. Rick points out that he thinks school is an utter waste of time; before leaving the room, he compliments the breakfast which his daughter Beth made, causing her to cry tears of joy and stop being angry with her father, much to her husband Jerry's annoyance.At school later that day, Mr. Goldenfold administers a math test, and Morty falls asleep, sinking into a dream filled with numbers. The dream quickly, however, evolves into a sexual encounter with Jessica, in which she asks him to play with her exposed breasts. Mr. Goldenfold unwittingly finds himself on the receiving end of Morty's subconscious fantasy. Later, Morty is accosted by a bully named Frank ; appearing out of nowhere, Rick uses a freeze-ray to stop him and convinces Morty to skip History because he needs \"an extra pair of hands\" in another dimension. Rick and Morty then leave school, leaving Frank frozen and teetering in the hallway. Walking by (and not realizing that he is frozen), Summer tries to impress Frank, but the front of his foot cracks, and he topples and shatters into pieces on the floor causing Summer to scream.On his lunch break, Jerry visits his wife Beth while she is performing heart surgery to invite her to lunch, but she declines. He then proposes that they should put Rick in a nursing home, eliciting an aggravated response from Beth who lashes out at a nurse.In an alleyway, Rick opens a portal in a wall, and Rick and Morty both step into it, emerging onto a hillside in a colorful and oddly shaped world. Rick tells an awestruck Morty that they are in Dimension 35-C and explains that he needs mega-seeds from mega-trees for his research. When Morty expresses his anxiety about the strange situation, Rick tries to calm Morty down with a speech about facing your fears, but he is suddenly interrupted by a strange arachnid-like beast which chases them as Rick openly proclaims that he has never seen anything like it before and that they are going to die. After escaping the monster and passing by several other monsters, Rick interrupts another set of objections by Morty, directing Morty's attention to a grove of mega trees at the bottom of a steeply walled valley. After refusing to answer Morty as to what the nature of the mega seeds is, Rick gives Morty some grappling shoes with which to scale the wall. Morty steps over the edge and falls off the cliff, as Rick neglected to tell Morty to turn the shoes on.Meanwhile, Jerry and Beth are still arguing about whether or not to put Rick in a retirement home. Beth is upset, believing that her husband Jerry is trying to rob her of her father, who has only recently moved in with them, while Jerry believes that Rick is a terrible influence on their son Morty and needs to go. After a brief interruption by Beth's assistant, Davin , Beth counters her husband's argument, saying that Morty was having trouble in school before Rick moved in with them; the fact that Morty has a friend is more important to her than any potential detriment. The principal of school, Gene Vagina , calls, asking the couple to come to the school and talk to him.Back in Dimension 35-C, Morty lies on the ground at the bottom of the cliff, his legs terribly broken in more than three places. As Rick lectures Morty on the folly of failing to turn on the shoes, Morty yells at Rick for his indifference, and for his singular focus on the mega-seeds, rather than his injuries. Rick then leaves Morty, disappearing into a portal for a number of seconds before returning and injecting Morty's legs with a serum which cures Morty's broken legs. With his legs fully functional again, Morty uses his grappling shoes to get the mega-fruit, while Rick explains that he traveled to a future dimension in which technology, among other things, has halted the aging process. Unfortunately, he continues, he spent so much time in the alternate dimension that his portal gun has exhausted its charge. As Morty panics, Rick explains that they'll have to go through inter-dimensional customs and that, in order to keep the seeds hidden, Morty will have to smuggle the mega-seeds through customs in his rectum. Morty objects, but Rick persists, as years of smuggling have rendered him unable to do the same.Meeting with Principal Vagina, Jerry and Beth are informed that their son Morty has attended school for a total of seven hours over a two-month period. In addition, the principal tells them that Rick is the one who has been removing Morty from school.Having reached customs, Rick and Morty discover that the insect-like security guards have a new machine that \"detects stuff all the way up [someone's] butt.\" Rick yells at Morty to run and pushes the guard to the ground, and they both make a break for it as the guards close in on them, passing by various creatures from other dimensions. Rick destroys several things in the customs to slow security down and also assaults two aliens who are bystanders. Using the grappling shoes and other methods of avoidance, the two manage to get to a portal, but Rick has to enter the coordinates of their home dimension. As the guards begin to shoot at them, Rick tells Morty to shoot back at them, telling him that they are robots. When Morty shoots one of them , however, he finds that they are not robots but living organisms. Rick explains that he was using a metaphor: the guards are bureaucrats, and he does not respect them. During the firefight, a Wilhelm Scream can be heard. Finishing the coordinate input, Rick pulls Morty through the portal into the school cafeteria; Morty lands in front of Jessica, impressing her. Unfortunately, Jerry, Beth, and the principal catch them.The spouses start moving Rick's stuff, all of which is in the garage, into a moving van, intending to move him into a nursing home. Rick argues with his daughter and son-in-law, who reveal that Morty has a learning disability. Rick then asks Morty to state the square root of pi and the first law of thermodynamics, both of which he promptly and correctly recites. He explains that having adventures is the best way for Morty to learn, and tells them that, later in his own life, Morty will be doing amazing things as a result of their adventures. husband and wife relent, happy and content that Morty is learning. Rick then tells Morty that none of what he told his parents is true: his super-intelligence is temporary, one of the side effects of the mega-seeds breaking down in his rectal cavity. As the other side effects take hold of Morty, he loses his brain function and control of his motor skills, and Rick starts rambling about the future adventures they will have: \"Rick and Morty, forever and ever, a hundred years, Rick and Morty...\" The episode ends with the garage door closing as Rick continues on rambling."}, "1": {"title": "Lawnmower Dog", "text": " Jerry complains that the family dog, Snuffles, is stupid so Rick gives Jerry a device that enhances the dog's intelligence. He and Morty then go into the dreams of Morty's math teacher to persuade him to give Morty an \"A\" in class so Morty can be assigned less homework. They go from Morty's math teacher's dreams to the dreams of a strong black female TV character named Mrs. Pancakes , to a centaur's dreams, and so on. This results in Rick and Morty eventually encountering Scary Terry (a parody of Freddy Krueger, the villain inA Nightmare on Elm Street). Scary Terry begins chasing the two of them through multiple dreams, causing Rick to become unhinged.At one point the two come across a dream of a post-apocalyptic city where they decide to hide from Scary Terry until he gets tired. When Scary Terry eventually sleeps, Rick and Morty enter his dreams and quickly persuade him to help the duo complete their mission. Meanwhile, after watching several exaggerated infomercials on dogs, Snuffles builds an advanced mechanical suit with a translator to speak to humans. He assembles a robot dog army and proceeds to take over the human race. Rick finds Morty and gives him pills which will make his kidneys shut down.Morty is later seen lying down on a hospital bed in a critical state with Snuffles by his side trying to keep him alive. Snuffles awakens (the aforementioned scenario is revealed to be a dream) and realizes that colonizing earth isn't the answer and that dog-kind must not fall to the fate of humankind with its heartbreak and cruelty. Snuffles and Morty have a tearful goodbye as Snuffles leaves for another planet for intelligent dogs where compassion is exercised and \"pet insurance is mandatory.\"After the credits, Rick and Scary Terry are shown in Scary Class, now being taught by Scary Mr. Johnson, who asks to be called Scary Glen. Instead of Fundamentals of Fear, Scary Glen tells his students they first need to learn \"how to chill.\""}, "2": {"title": "Anatomy Park (Episode)", "text": "It's Christmas, and Jerry tries to enforce the idea of a \"human holiday\" onto the rest of the family for his  parents visiting, confiscating Morty , Beth and Summer 's electronic gadgets. Rick then shows up with a homeless man in a Santa outfit he briefly introduces as Ruben before heading into the garage.As the holiday progresses, Jerry realizes that his traditional idea of a family Christmas has been usurped by the introduction of Jacob , his mother's lover, who has entered a three-way relationship with his parents. While the rest of the family accepts and supports the relationship, Jerry becomes insecure and defensive, allowing his anxiety over his parents' relationship to negatively affect him throughout the episode.Meanwhile, Morty finds out that Rick has created a Jurassic Park-style amusement park inside Ruben the homeless man, and that he is needed inside Ruben's body. Rick shrinks him down to microscopic size and injects him into Ruben's chest cavity, allowing him to meet Dr. Xenon Bloom and the other residents of Anatomy Park. Ruben soon dies from a multitude of bacteria and viruses that have run rampant through his body, and the crew has to escape it to survive. As they make their way through Anatomy Park , Morty begins to fall for Annie , an employee of Anatomy Park, who begins the journey apathetic of his plight but who soon grows to fancy him. The crew discovers that Poncho had planned to compromise the safety of Anatomy Park, to get back at Dr. Bloom, but he falls to his death trying to fight off the bubonic plague , with Roger drowning in shit soon after.Meanwhile, Summer's boyfriend Ethan barges into the house asking why she has been ignoring all his texts, which leads to an argument. Jacob manages to bring Ethan to confess the source of his anger.Back in the body, Dr. Bloom, Annie, and Morty sit in a room watching an animatronic Reuben explain his history. The body soon begins to collapse and the crew has to try and ride a skeletal railway system (or, \"The Bone Train\") out to Reuben's nipple. Dr. Bloom is eaten alive by E. coli while trying to operate the bone train, whilst Morty and Annie are almost eaten by Hepatitis A , but Hepatitis C comes to their rescue.Meanwhile, Rick has put Ruben's body into his ship and flown him and miniature Morty and crew out into space. He activates a growth ray on the corpse, leading to nationwide panic over the \"naked sky Santa\". The body soon explodes via dynamite Rick put in while picking up Morty and Annie, raining bloody chunks all over America and the Smith household.Rick, Morty, and Annie arrive back at the house, where Annie reveals that she's been studying Dr. Bloom's work and has the knowledge capable to build a new one. Rick shrinks her back down, leaving Morty depressed.In the after-credits scene, Rick talks to Annie on speakerphone, where the new crew reveals plans to scrap Rick's special ride, \"Pirates of the Pancreas.\" He hangs up on them and rants to Ethan, the site of the new Anatomy Park, about compromise. It is unknown how Ethan's later mutation via the Morphixer-XE affected the new park and those inside it."}, "3": {"title": "M. Night Shaym-Aliens!", "text": "The episode opens with Rick dissecting a large rat in the garage complaining about the sloppy workmanship. Morty stops in to comment on the beautiful day before a robotic Beth gets into a car and leaves for work. Rick is shown acting suspicious of the day's events, as well as Morty. Morty leaves for school and is called up to the front of the \"math class\" by Mr. Goldenfold , who asks him to teach the class, despite Morty's seemingly incorrect answer to a math question. A classmate asks Morty to share the recipe for concentrated dark matter , and a reluctant Morty is nearly enticed by Jessica into doing so before Rick bursts in and pulls Morty away.Rick tells Morty to get naked as they scramble into some locker room showers. Rick explains that they are actually trapped in a simulation of real-life by a race of 'intergalactic scammers' called Zigerions . Rick tells Morty that they'll be safe if they're naked, as the alien race is immensely uncomfortable with the sight of nudity.Meanwhile, Jerry has accidentally been abducted into the simulation too, and calmly goes about the day's events without noticing the numerous glitches, as his simulation is made to run on very low capacity. Jerry drives to work and gives a pitch for a marketing slogan for apples ('Hungry for Apples?'), which the board members approve. Jerry is filled with unbounded confidence and promptly leaves to make love to the simulated Beth.Rick and Morty plan an impromptu rap concert, and Rick orders the crowd to perform a wide variety of actions in order to saturate the RAM and freeze the CPU, thus, the simulation. The duo manages to escape from the simulation, sneak into the ship, steal some Crystallized Core Processing Units and proceed to an escape pod. As they fly back to Earth and return to the garage, Rick's enters the passcode to a hidden safe, which refuses to open. The garage then melts away, proving that they are still trapped in the simulation. Prince Nebulon appears and taunts Rick for thinking he escaped, revealing that the Zigerions have always had the recipe for concentrated dark matter, but Rick pulls Morty's pants down to cause a diversion, leading to a chase throughout the ship. Back in the simulation, Jerry returns to work in order to confess his slogan is a rip-off of 'Got Milk?', but his boss is caught in an infinite loop of snapping his fingers and saying \"Yes!\". In the span of a minute Jerry is fired, rehired, promoted, and then nominated for an 'Appley Award' (a fictional award that Jerry made up just seconds earlier). Jerry wins the award, and gives a heartfelt speech about how that day was the best day of his life, before the simulation crashes.Rick and Morty reunite with Jerry as they attempt to find a real escape pod to use. They climb into one but are promptly pursued by Zigerion ships, and Rick decides to put together some concentrated dark matter to escape. Morty asks for the recipe, and Rick orders Morty to mix 2 parts cesium, 1 part plutonic quartz, and bottled water to create the concentrated dark matter. But then, Morty freezes with he and the ship fading away, proving that it was just Rick and Jerry in the simulation all along. Prince Nebulon reappears victorious and allows them to leave.While throwing a victory celebration, the Zigerions mix the listed components to make the dark matter, but their ship promptly explodes, proving that Rick knew he was in a simulation since at least the time he was tricked into entering the safe combination. Rick sings the saxophone part to Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty as their shuttle flies away.In a post-credits sequence, Jerry gives the 'Hungry for Apples?' pitch at an actual board meeting and is fired on the spot. A drunken Rick approaches the real Morty in bed, pulling a knife on him and yelling at him, calling him a \"little son of a bitch\" repeatedly, to prove he's not a simulation before passing out asleep."}, "4": {"title": "Meeseeks and Destroy", "text": "Mr. Meeseeks, existing to solve Beth's problemAfter a particularly traumatic adventure, Morty tries to quit all future adventures. Rick pleads for him to continue being his sidekick, but allows him to lead his own adventure. The two strike a bet with each other:\u00a0if the trip is a success then Morty will get to lead every tenth adventure, if the trip is a failure Morty will no longer complain.\nThe rest of the Smith family bugs Rick for a solution to several mundane problems. Rick gives the family the Meeseeks Box , a gadget capable of instantaneously summoning helpers named Mr. Meeseeks . These blue creatures exist only to solve the task at hand. Once their task is solved, the creatures instantly disappear from existence. Rick assures the family that the creatures are happy to die, and warns them to keep their tasks simple. When Rick and Morty leave, Beth asks her Meeseeks to help her become a more complete woman while Summer wants hers to make her more popular at school. Jerry put off by their apparently difficult requests, asks his Meeseeks to do something comparatively simple sounding and help knock two strokes off his golf game.Morty leads Rick on an adventure through a fantasy world. They stop at a poor village that requests the help of two heroes to help raise money for them. The villagers point towards the sky, where a world of Giants awaits. Morty and Rick climb up a giant plant stalk to the Giant's world and wait on the giant's table for him to emerge. A giant named Dale , appears smelling Rick and Morty and is about to start looking for them (with the intention of eating them) when he suddenly slips over and bangs his head on the corner of the table, killing himself. Dale's wife, Rose , and their son walk in and see the scene, and Rick and Morty are quickly arrested for Dale's \"murder\".Summer's Meeseeks quickly makes her more popular at school by giving an inspiring speech that wins her a lot of friends, while Beth's takes her on a date and gives her some encouraging advice. However, Jerry struggles to improve at golf despite the coaching from his Meeseeks. Jerry is ready to give up, but his Meeseeks can't stop existing until it completes its task and decides to summon another Meeseeks to help. It isn't long before Jerry is surrounded by several Meeseeks all desperate to get Jerry to improve since many of them haven't had to exist that long, which leads to the Meeseeks slowly losing sanity as their task fails to be completed. Soon, there are dozens of Meeseeks created but Jerry still isn't improving making everyone involved frustrated. An exasperated Beth heads to dinner and Jerry goes along, telling the complaining Meeseeks that his golf game is more their concern than his. After they've gone, all the Meeseeks blame each other for their predicament and argue over the correct solution soon descending into a massive brawl, tearing each other apart (whichstilldoesn't kill them) while creating more and more Meeseeks to join in the fight. Eventually, the original Meeseeks, having been alive for over two days (an eternity in Meeseeks time), tells his fellows that he has a solution to permanently take all strokes off Jerry's game, by killing him.Rick and Morty are tried in a Giant's Court but are let go thanks to a technicality. Rick tries to convince Morty to throw in the towel, but he refuses. As the duo climb down several of the Courthouse's giant stairs, they find a tavern called the Thirsty Step . Morty, still bounding with confidence about the success of his adventure, confronts Rick about his constant negative attitude before going to the bathroom. While washing his hands, he runs into Mr. Jellybean . Mr. Jellybean asks Morty about his adventure and Morty tells him that he's nervous that it might have gotten out of hand. When Mr. Jellybean points out that adventures are supposed to be full of surprises Morty cheers up and decides to \"go with the flow.\" However, Mr. Jellybean then wraps his arms around Morty and asks him to stay and \"go with the flow.\" Understandably unsettled by this impulsive tact Morty tries to leave before Mr. Jellybean shoves him against the sinks. Realizing that Mr. Jellybean's attempting to rape him Morty starts to panic. Unfortunately, no one can hear his screams as Rick is singing Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Sweet Home Alabama\" on the karaoke machine. Morty is force into one of the stalls but fortunately manages to fend Mr. Jellybean off, although he is visibly shaken afterward. Morty emerges from the bathroom and finds Rick playing cards. Rick apologizes for his previous negative attitude and tells Morty that he's having a good time as he had just won a lot of money in several games of cards. Morty on the other hand is trembling terribly and tells Rick that the adventure's over and they should just leave. Confused, Rick tells Morty that he's in the middle of a game at which point Morty tearfully breaks down and tells Rick that he'll accept losing the bet and begs Rick to take them back home. Rick pieces together what happened when he notices a bruised Mr. Jellybean leaving the bathroom and persuades Morty to get a ride down to the village and share his winnings with the townspeople. Morty cheers up, and the two leave.Beth and Jerry go out to dinner, and the horde of Mr. Meeseeks descend on the restaurant wielding various weapons. Jerry and Beth escape into the restaurant's freezer, and the Mr. Meeseeks began taking hostages to coerce Jerry to come out. Jerry almost gives in, but Beth encourages him to try his golf swing one last time. Jerry emerges from the freezer and uses a severed pipe and tomato to prove that his swing has improved. The Mr. Meeseeks celebrate and disappear, all except for one 'stickler' Mr. Meeseeks who takes a hostage and asks to see Jerry's short game. Jerry hits an onion into a coffee cup, which finally dispatches all of the Mr. Meeseeks.After sharing their remaining money with the villages, Rick congratulates Morty on a successful adventure and agrees that Morty has won the bet. The villagers then ask Rick and Morty to meet their king, who turns out to be Mr. Jellybean. Morty quickly declines and Rick opens the portal to home. The duo quickly hop through the portal and leave as quickly as possible. However, not content with allowing Mr. Jellybean to get away with his attempted rape, Rick quickly re-opens the portal and his hand emerges from the portal with a laser gun, which he uses to shoot and kill Mr. Jellybean, much to the horror of the villagers.The trauma of the restaurant incident helps patch together Jerry and Beth's relationship for the time being.In an after-credits scene, one of the villagers is sadly looking at the memorial statute made in honor of Mr. Jellybean when his squire arrives with shoe-box filled with photographs, clearly frazzled by something. He tells the villager that the box had been found in a locked chest in the closet of Mr. Jellybeans estate. The villager looks at the photographs and gags at the horrifying discovery. His squire suggests that they tell the people, but the villager orders him to burn it instead, claiming that the villagers would be better off remembering Mr. Jellybean for the idea that he represented to them rather than for his true disgusting nature. The episode ends with a shot of his (rather suggestive) statue of his with his arms around a child in his underwear."}, "5": {"title": "Rick Potion 9", "text": " Morty is very interested in Jessica , but lacks the opportunity to ever talk to her as he's either too shy or his attempts are shut down by Brad whenever he tries. With the annual Flu Season Dance coming up, Morty talks to Jerry about his issue. Jerry compares Morty's fondness for Jessica to his own fondness for Beth when he was a teenager. Rick overhears Jerry's story and reminds him that said fondness resulted in Jerry getting Beth pregnant at 17. Rick proceeds to warn Morty not to go to Jerry for romantic advice because, \"his marriage is hanging on by a thread\". An insulted Jerry remarks that there isn't a problem with his marriage. Unconvinced, Rick tells Jerry that he can believe what he wants but it's pretty obvious that Beth is looking for an excuse to leave him. Morty becomes upset and asks Rick not to talk about his parents in that fashion. In response, Rick tells Morty that what people interpret as, \"love\" is just a chemical that causes animals to breed and once that has happened, any true passion fades away. After Rick leaves, a depressed Morty goes upstairs to prepare for the dance and a nervous Jerry goes to check on Beth. Thinking about what Rick told him, Morty approaches Rick and requests a potion that can make Jessica like him. After a brief argument, Rick calls Morty a, \"thorn in his ass\" and gives Morty a serum based off the genetic makeup of voles, a rodent that pair bonds with its mate for life. Before leaving, Morty asks if there's anything that could go wrong with the serum and Rick answers no. Once Morty has left, however, Rick quickly adds, \"unless she has the flu\", but shrugs it off.At the dance, Morty uses the serum on Jessica, and, save for her dilated pupils, it seems to be a success. When Brad sees Jessica holding Morty, he becomes angry and tries to wrestle him away from her. Things only get worse when Jessica begins to sneeze. The serum, which has piggy-backed onto the flu virus and has caused the virus to replicate in seconds, is seen to go airborne, infects Brad with the serum. Brad quickly apologizes to Morty but begins to make sexual advances on Morty which leads to another scuffle between Jessica and Brad. Eventually Principal Vagina leads Brad away, while Brad sneezes causing the serum laced flu virus to enter the fruit punch and air vents. Soon everyone at the dance is infected with the flu and subsequently the serum. Morty prays that everything go according to plan, when Jessica starts aggressively telling Morty to have sex with her on the spot, in front of the entire school. Morty is unsurprisingly mortified and Jessica's friend tells her to control herself, before she begins to make advances on Morty as well. Morty slowly backs up and notices that everyone in the room now has dilated pupils and they're all looking at him lustfully. Realizing what has happened with dread, Morty feebly whimpers, \"Oh, crap!\". The students and faculty swarm around Morty, with each of them violently competing to have Morty for themselves. Morty eventually manages to get away from everyone and makes a break for the exit where Rick is waiting for him. Rick tells Morty that he realized that he messed up and explains how this all happened. Terrified, Morty asks Rick what they're going to do and Rick tells him that he's already whipped up an antidote using praying mantis DNA as the base, claiming that they're the, \"opposite of voles\" due to their nature to only mate once before the female devours the male.Rick releases his antidote along with a second, more powerful airborne virus. Upon releasing the new airborne serum, Rick tells Morty that the serum doesn't affect anyone related to Morty by blood so luckily it means none of his family will want to have sex with him. For a moment, the antidote appears to have been successful, until everybody starts growing mantis-like features and other appendages. Now not only do they still wish to copulate with Morty but also have the urge to behead and eat him afterward. This Mantis-love virus soon infects the entire Earth population, all of which not only wish to mate with Morty but consume him afterwards.Meanwhile, Jerry approaches Beth and asks her if she still loves him. Beth tells Jerry that loving him is the equivalent of building a homeless shelter, work that nobody wants to do but people who care will do so anyway. She then is called in to work late to help out with some horses after an incident at the racetrack and Jerry begins to suspect she may be having an affair. Despite Summer 's warnings, Jerry decides to stop by St. Equis Hospital where his wife works. On the way, he encounters a massive roadblock on the highway and is confronted by several mutated victims. Finding a shotgun in an abandoned police car, Jerry arms himself and shoots his way through the horde. After a successful surgery, Beth's coworker Davin makes a move before being infected by the Mantis-love virus. Just then, Jerry, in tattered clothes, busts in with a crowbar and beats him to death. Meanwhile, Rick and Morty travel to a secluded area in the desert. While Rick tries to concoct a third serum to undo all of his previous work Morty is watching the news and is horrified to find that the virus has spread across the entire planet. Rick then claims that he has created the solution by taking the DNA from several sources, including koala, rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, golden retriever, shark, and dinosaur. Morty is confused by Rick's concoction and asks how it would put people back to normal, but only gets chastised by Rick for questioning him. As they fly over the town, Rick tries to build up hype so he can rub his supposed success in Morty's face, until Morty finally just grows tired of Rick's arrogance and releases the third airborne virus himself. At first the serum seems to have worked, as some people are returned to normal, but just as quickly, people begin turning into disfigured, humanoid blobs that Rick dubs \" Cronenbergs .\" Rick then sarcastically says, \"You're welcome.\" to Morty, claiming that he made him the, \"mayor of, 'I told you so town'\". The world is soon overrun with these disfigured monsters, and Jerry and Beth fight their way through them to survive, eventually reuniting with Summer.As dawn breaks, Rick and Morty sit upon a rooftop overlooking the chaos around them. Rick tries to be light-hearted and jokingly points out that no one wants to have sex with Morty any more so they must be going in the right direction. Morty, on the other hand, is still absolutely horrified by the fact that the world was in ruin and asks Rick how he could have been so irresponsible. Not willing to take the blame, Rick reminds Morty that he was the one who asked for the serum to begin with, and claimed that Morty was a total creep. Morty accepts his responsibility for the disaster but he quickly reminds Rick that he was the one who botched the original serum, mixed a bunch of random genes together, hoped for the best and ended up turning the entire world population into Cronenbergs.Furthermore, Morty declares that Rick had to figure out a way to fix everything. At wits end for what to do, Rick then ultimately decides to use his final emergency solution. The scene cuts to Rick and Morty's garage, with Morty congratulating Rick on saving the world from the Cronenbergs. Rick asks Morty for his screwdriver, and gladly begins to finish his invention from earlier. Just as Rick twists the screw the third time, the device violently explodes, instantly (and messily) killing Rick and Morty. The Rick and Morty from the rooftop scene then step out from a portal, and Morty panics at the sight of incredibly bloody garage with the corpses of him and his grandfather lying limp and burnt on ground; until Rick calms him down by telling Morty that there are an infinite number of realities and in a few of them he managed to save the world from the viruses. Rick further explains the he just had to find one of those realities in which they died soon afterwards so that they could come in and take their place.\n A still horrified Morty asks Rick what was going to happen to the world they left behind only for Rick to tell him there's nothing they can do, so they shouldn't think about it. Rick further remarks that Morty should be glad that he messed as much as he did because if he hadn't, they would have been the versions of themselves that died in an explosion. The episode ends with Rick and Morty, burying their dead bodies in the backyard. Upon finishing, Morty, with a thousand-yard stare , returns into the house in a daze, looks around at his new home and sits on the couch, clearly shell-shocked by all that has happened.After the credits, the remainder of the Smith family of the Prime Dimension is shown living out of a van fitted with armor and survival equipment and roasting a dead Cronenberg over a fire. Summer creates her own TV shows standing in a cardboard box while her parents, Jerry and Beth, admit they don't miss Rick and Morty at all and despite the world falling apart, they have actually found happiness. Meanwhile, Cronenberg Rick and Cronenberg Morty transport from a reality they call Cronenberg World in which Cronenberg Rick accidentally turned everyone into normal human beings."}, "6": {"title": "Raising Gazorpazorp", "text": "While Rick haggles with the owner of an intergalactic pawn shop, Morty spots a sex robot at the back of the shop and asks if he can have it, saying that it \"looks cool\" and claiming that he needs a souvenir from his adventures with Rick in case his grandfather ever passes away. Dismissively, Rick concedes.Back on Earth, the rest of Morty's family is perturbed with his newly sexually active lifestyle with the robot, with Jerry particularly vocal against it since all Morty does is stay in his room with the robot. Beth points out that Morty is undergoing puberty and insists that Jerry not intervene, though remains cautiously open to the idea when Morty calls for Rick's help and her father goes upstairs.Morty reveals a floating metal ball which he claims is \" Gwendolyn \" the robot. The rest of the family, alerted by the commotion from Rick trying to secure the ball, witness the metal ball give birth to a infant and turn back into the robot. Inspecting the robot's insides, Rick confirms that the robot was given the ability to give birth and the infant contains half of Morty's DNA, to the shock of Morty and the family. Before he can put down the alien infant, he is stopped by the rest of the family who ask him to let it live, despite his protests. Rick decides to take the robot to the garage and inspect it further while Morty is determined to raise the alien, who Morty now calls it \" Morty Jr. \" as his own.As Summer visits the garage, Rick identifies the robot's origin as the planet Gazorpazorp in the Andromeda system, and explains that he intends to send Morty Jr. back to his home planet and find suitable parents for him. Summer hints that she wishes to go an adventure with her grandfather like Morty does, but Rick dismisses her, claiming that he doesn't take \"chicks\" on adventures, which offends Summer. Summer is suddenly seized through the portal Rick opens by male Gazorpians, forcing Rick to follow. Meanwhile, Jerry and Beth both attempt to give Morty parenting advice, but end up disagreeing with their different parenting styles, alluding to their own disappointments with their children. Morty snaps, demanding his parents to back off, instead turning on the television to show Morty Jr. a children's show; both Jerry and Beth agree that Morty will inevitably fail with his parenting.On Gazorpazorp, Summer is nearly raped by the male Gazorpians until Rick rescues her in time, but the resulting fight destroys his portal gun. Rick attempts repairs on the gun with parts from broken sex robots littered on the planet while Summer is forced to conceal herself in a burqa, disgusted at the backwards, patriarchal state of the planet. She is offended by Rick's suggestion that the male Gazorpians removed their females for efficiency due to their advancement and eventually caused a fallout that knocked them back to their \"Stone Age\". Just then, a gigantic floating stone head arrives above the male Gazorpians to drop more sex robots, which the males copulate with. Rick and Summer grapple onto one of the robots and enter the stone head, which is revealed to be run by refined female Gazorpians who profess severe distaste for males, forcing Summer and Rick to fake a master-slave relationship.The female Gazorpians bring Rick and Summer to their underground matriachal utopia, bringing them before their leader Ma-Sha. Ma-Sha reveals that the female Gazorpians chose to separate themselves from the males. To continue their species they created the sex robots and separate the resulting babies by gender; the little girls are educated into their society while the children are evicted onto the planet's surface. When Summer exclaims about the infants being just children, Ma-Sha tells her that Gazorpian males mature within a day and become one of the most violent, aggressive species in the universe. Rick realizes that Morty is in big trouble, as is Earth. Indeed, as Morty Jr. matures from infancy to childhood, Morty is horrified as Morty Jr. expresses desire to cause destruction, murder and mayhem, and insists on keeping Morty Jr. indoors, claiming that the atmosphere outside is poisonous to Morty Jr. However, this causes Morty Jr's relationship with Morty to become strained as when Morty tries to divert Morty Jr's attention to a dance on a children show, he ends up yelling at Morty Jr, causing Morty Jr to cry, something that Jerry and Beth remark \"Nice\".Summer explains to Ma-Sha that a male Gazorpian was born on her planet, causing Ma-Sha to question her on the state of gender equality on Earth. This prompting an argument between Rick and Summer about gender roles on Earth, culminating in Rick popping a massive, resounding fart in protest, to the disgust of the female Gazorpians. Upon hearing Summer refer to Rick as \"grandfather\" and realizing that Summer is the product of male/female reproduction, Ma-Sha orders their arrest. At the same time, Morty Jr. has grown into adolescence, picked up smoking and demands to be allowed to his warlike tendencies after watching documentaries on the History channel. Following an argument with Morty, Morty Jr. runs out of the house; discovering that the air is not poisonous to him, he runs away.Ma-Sha sentences Summer and Rick to death, revealing after some bickering with Rick that they are to be crushed under a falling boulder. When Rick apologizes to Summer about their impending fate and complements her top, it gives her an idea. Summer protests by pointing out her top which Ma-Sha earlier complimented, which she explains was designed by a male Earthling fashion designer and proves it by showing them the design label. Saying that a fraction of male Earthlings are born gay, Summer explains that while gender separation has worked out well on Gazorpazorp, the same standards would not work on Earth nor would it be fair to enforce female Gazorpian standards on humans. Since the female Gazorpians acknowledge that she is better dressed than them in clothes made by a male, Ma-Sha should release them. Ma-Sha concedes, giving them a spaceship so Summer and Rick can return to their \"weird planet, where women are equal but not really\".On Earth, Morty Jr. has begun a rampage following an epiphany backed by music. Driven on Jerry's car, Morty tries to calm Morty Jr. down, which he eventually succeeds in. Morty admits to Morty Jr. that he is an alien and he wasn't a good father, but explains that he really wanted Morty Jr. to channel his destructive nature to creative outlets. Brad Anderson, the creator of the comic stripMarmaduke, agrees as he walks by, revealing that Marmaduke is his creative outlet through which he channels his violent and sexual thoughts. Morty and Morty Jr. share a farewell hug just as Rick and Summer return to Earth, with Rick giving ownership of the Gazorpian spaceship to Summer. Beth asks where Rick has been, and Rick answers her by popping another fart which the whole family laughs at.Following the credits, Morty Jr. is seen on a television show (watched by everyone in the Smith household) with a talk show host, having matured into a middle-aged man and now the best-selling author of a book titled \"My Horrible Father\" about his childhood experience. As Morty cringes, the family are stunned to watch and Beth assures her son that parenting is a thankless task and in the end he did the best he could. Downcast, Morty hopes that Jr. is eating enough."}, "7": {"title": "Rixty Minutes", "text": "The Smith Family are gathered around the television, invested in a 'Bachelor' style reality show. Rick expresses disgust at the quality of television, and Jerry challenges him to provide anything better. Rick destroys the existing cable box and installs his own: a cable box capable of receiving television across infinite dimensions. The shows featured in these alternate realities vary wildly, such as a Showtime crime show in a reality where people evolved from corn. Rick flips through the channels to show the endless possibilities, before the family sees Jerry in an episode of David Letterman, in a reality where he was a famous movie star. This excites the rest of the family, and Rick gets annoyed feeling that they are getting obsessed about the wrong things.Rick pulls out a pair of Inter-Dimensional Goggles that he throws into the kitchen, in which Jerry, Beth , and Summer chase after. Morty says he does not care about himself enough to see what his alternate self would be like, in which Rick congratulates him. The two then watch various commercials and clips from alternate realities.Meanwhile, Jerry, Beth, and Summer are in the kitchen taking turns using the goggles. Jerry sees himself doing cocaine with Johnny Depp while Beth sees herself operating on a person instead of a horse. Summer has trouble finding any other realities of her, except for a moment of the family playing Yahtzee . It's during this time that she first finds out that she was an unwanted pregnancy, and the news upsets her greatly. Seeing her parents achieve their dreams in realities where she was not born, she tells them that she is running away.The alternate realities of their lives shake Jerry and Beth to the core, and they decide that maybe it'd be better to spend time apart. Summer goes upstairs and begins to pack, and Morty attempts to console her. She attempts to push him away, thinking Morty is going to use cliches such as a childhood drawing before he points outside to the graves in the backyard (from the episode \" Rick Potion No. 9 \"). He reveals the truth that he is not, in fact, her real brother but a brother from another reality. Morty tells Summer \"Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody is going to die... Come watch TV?\"Beth keeps the goggles on while lying on the floor of the kitchen, enjoying her alternate life. The television in the main room shows alternate reality Jerry having a drug-induced breakdown, stripped down to his underwear, his head half-shaven, and driving a mobility scooter on a freeway with droves of police cars behind him. Rick almost changes the channel, but Jerry yells at him to keep it. They watch as alternate reality Jerry arrives at the doorstep of an alternate reality Beth, telling her that he hated his life and regretted not continuing their relationship. Beth and Jerry are stunned, as they run to each other to embrace.In the post-credit sequence, the Smith family is watching the news in a Hamster-in-Butt World. The family asks Rick a wide variety of questions about the world until he begrudgingly creates a portal to the world so they can 'ask them yourselves.' Jerry excitedly calls it a family vacation and the Smith family spend a vacation in Hamster-In-Butt World where a photo montage show them all having a good time (even Rick at the end)."}, "8": {"title": "Something Ricked This Way Comes", "text": "The Smith family are eating breakfast.

Summer asks for a ride to her job, which is defaulted to Rick since Jerry is 'busy'.Rick gives Summer a ride to her job, which is helping out an eccentric old man run a 'vintage thrift store' called Needful Things . The shop is run by Mr. Needful , and has just opened recently. Before Rick and Summer arrive, Mr. Goldenfold arrives by accident (thinking the shop was a Jamba Juice). Mr. Needful knows his name without introduction and gives him an aftershave to help capture female attention. The aftershave is free, but Mr. Needful states \"Nobody ever pays here...not with money\".Summer and Rick arrive into the shop, and Rick is immediately suspicious of Mr. Needful, asking whether he is the devil. This accusation startles Mr. Needful who quickly tries to give Rick a microscope, which Rick reluctantly takes as Summer pushes him out the door. Meanwhile, Jerry and Morty begin to work on a solar system model for his science project. Jerry states that Pluto is a planet and Morty attempts to correct him. However, Jerry refuses to say that Pluto is not a planet.Morty visits Rick in his garage, where Rick scans the microscope and finds that using it would have significantly lowered his IQ. Jerry barges in assuming Morty is asking Rick about whether Pluto is a planet or not. Jerry vehemently argues that if it was once a planet, it could be a planet again. Mr. Goldenfold returns to Needful Things, saying that the aftershave worked but made him impotent. After Rick arrives and administers a cure into Goldenfold, he reveals that he has invented a device to identify the negative effects of the cursed items. Rick goes around the store, scanning all the items and revealing their curses which scares away the customer base. Mr. Needful and Rick briefly fight before Summer pushes Rick out the door.Jerry attempts to call NASA to argue about Pluto's planetary status. However, the two are quickly abducted by an alien ship and taken to Pluto, where they meet King Flippynips, the ruler of Pluto. The king is overjoyed that Jerry believes Pluto is a planet, and Jerry becomes a spokesperson to the population, assuring them that they are still a planet. The large cheering crowd quickly inflates Jerry's ego.Needful Things begins to sell a variety of items, but Summer and Mr. Needful discover it's because Rick has opened another shop across the street called Curse Purge Plus! . The shop removes the curses for a fee, and is an instant hit. This causes a strain on Mr. Needful's confidence and he attempts to kill himself, but is saved by Summer. Summer arrives into Rick's shop to concede defeat, which results in Rick getting bored and burning the shop to the ground.Jerry becomes famous to the Pluto population, appearing in various events to advocate that Pluto is a planet. Morty meets Scroopy Noopers , a Plutonian scientist who reveals that major corporations are mining plutonium from Pluto's core, thus making the planet shrink and slowly die. Jerry's opinions fall into line with these corporations, who are desperate to keep the public uninformed about the problems. Morty's attempts to persuade his father to tell the populace the truth falls on deaf ears. It's only when King Flippynips captures Scroopy Noopers and reveals he's his son does Jerry work the courage to tell the population of Pluto their problems.Mr. Needful opens a new business in the technology realm, opening n33dful.com to ravenous reviews. As he congratulates the workforce, he orders security on them and quickly fires Summer who feels betrayed. She reaches out to Rick who offers an idea.

The trio agree as Beth and Jerry drive off. Summer ignores the warnings and attempts to throw a party to become popular. Rick declines due to his plans to throw a party of his own.Beth and Jerry arrive at Titanic 2, which is a replica of the ill fated ship the RMS Titanic. Jerry sees the line to reenact the famous bow scene from the movie and tries to bring Beth along. Beth blows off his request, and shoves a nearby maid Lucy to join him instead. The two bond quickly over a mutual love for the Titanic. Meanwhile, the party at the Smith Residence begins. Some of the party-goers include Glip Glops , Brad , Bird Person , Gear Head , Squanchy and many more. The party begins to amp up and Morty confronts Rick about their decisions. Jessica appears, and Morty shifts his attention to talking to her. Jerry and Lucy continue to enjoy themselves on the ship, but the planned sinking of the ship goes wrong, and the ship doesn't sink due to technical difficulties. Rick's party is getting crazier, Summer blows off a friend of hers named Nancy , which draws criticism from Rick. Abrodolph Lincoler then smashes through a wall. He gets into a brief altercation with Brad who promptly beats him up. Jessica is upset and runs outside, and Morty joins her to console her. While showing her various gadgets in the garage, he walks in on Squanchy masturbating (or \"squanching,\" as he calls it) in a closet, and in the process accidentally knocks over a contraption that teleports the entire house into a weird planet.

Rick calms him down and tells him to collect some Collaxion Crystals , which would ostensibly be used to take them back home. Rick convinces Abrodolph Lincoler to join Morty, and Summer talks Nancy into joining them as well. The three set out to find the crystals. On the Titanic 2, Lucy finds Jerry and takes him to a storage room where she quickly strips naked and asks him to draw her. Meanwhile, Morty, Nancy, and Lincoler find the crystals but are attacked by a two-headed beast. Lincoler fends off the beast whilst Morty and Nancy collect the crystals. He is mortally wounded whilst defending them. The remainder of the group return to the party and give the crystals to Rick who promptly crushes them up and snorts them. Rick's eyes turn blue, as he gets high, and he starts a rave called the \"Rick Dance\" along with other party-goers. Rick admits that he can take them back whenever he wanted. Morty, furious after being lied to, throws the rest of the crystals outside. Meanwhile, Jerry attempts to break away from Lucy on the Titanic 2, but she pulls a gun on him and threatens him.

Beth and Jerry pack up their car to leave and Lucy attaches herself to the underside of the car. She holds on briefly before falling and being run over, presumably killing her. Meanwhile, Morty ends the party and forces everyone out. The Smith House is in total shambles, and the cleanup effort begins. Morty is still immensely upset at Rick, but a conversation with Bird Person reveals to him that Rick is masking a great deal of inner pain, and shows Morty that if he truly wants to stop dealing with his grandfather, he should just leave the place destroyed. At first, Morty agrees that this might be the best thing that ever happened to him because  will be free of Rick forever. Birdperson then teaches him another saying that means \"Whatever lets you sleep at night.\"Beth and Jerry arrive home, and Birdperson tells him to make his decision as he leaves with Tammy. Morty realizes he does want to continue on his adventures with Rick and  pleads with him to do something about the state of the house before his parents walk through the front door.

Outside of the Smith Residence , Morty and Summer finish up some last minute cleaning duties while Jerry and Beth are still frozen outside. It's revealed that time has been frozen for nearly six months. Before Rick unfreezes time, he admits that 'their' time may need time to stabilize back within the 'world's time'. As a precaution, he tells Morty and Summer not to touch their parents at all, or otherwise their existence might fall apart at the seams.When time is unfrozen, Mr. Benson falls off the roof while both Jerry and Beth are very clearly confused with the entire house not destroyed. Rick insists that Jerry was just seeing the negative and he warmly greets Beth. Beth attempts to hug her father and children, but they pull back, insisting it's because they missed them a lot and hugging would destroy them (it literally would). As a means to play it safe, Rick bribes the two into leaving to buy ice cream. He kicks a pile of unmarked bills to get them out of the house. Soon, Morty and Summer experience a bit of sibling rivalry over who's closer to Rick. As they shove each other, it generates a direct rift in time, creating two parallel realities which exist separately from each other. Rick tells his grandchildren that their 'uncertainty' has caused time to fracture into two equally possible impossibilities. Rick says they aren't in any timelines, and to prove it he opens the garage door to reveal the house floating in the middle of a black void surrounded by Schr\u00f6dinger's cats.After getting ice cream, Jerry and Beth accidentally strike a deer. The deer isn't killed but severely injured. Beth takes it upon herself to help heal the deer. Beth takes the deer into a veterinary hospital and attempts to perform surgery. Before she begins her procedure, she notices a gunshot wound in its side. A hunter appears and says he was the one who shot him. He claims the deer belongs to him and calls his lawyer to help him gain ownership. The hunter's lawyer appears at the animal hospital and lets them know about Brad's Law and how legally the deer belongs to the hunter. Beth ignores him and continues to operate.Rick uses a Time Crystal to try to mend the timelines together, but Morty and Summer's continued uncertainty prevents the fusion from working. Rick demands to know the reason behind their uncertainty. He deduces that the two of them 'want to be grandpa's favorite' and then sits them down in front of a whiteboard and cruelly tells both of them how little he cares about them and how little he values their contributions. His long speech clearly upsets both of them. Before Rick attempts to mend time together once again, Morty makes a quip about his drinking habits which directly result in Rick becoming uncertain. The time fusion fails for the second time and Rick immediately thinks that his 'other self' is trying to kill him off to fix the problem.Rick quickly creates a pistol with his time crystal and attempts to kill the other self. A shootout opens up with both Ricks across timelines trying to murder each other. The chaos results in time splitting a second time, leading to four separate realities. Morty knocks out Rick from behind in order to calm him down. Morty and Summer put Rick into a dog crate. Rick reawakens in the crate and proves he's certain across all four timelines by calling himself and leaving a message. He then receives three other voicemails simultaneously. Suddenly, a Fourth Dimensional Being appears and scolds Rick for attempting to piece time together with just a crystal. He gives Rick, Morty, and Summer time-stabilizing collars that then correctly fuse their times back to its regular place. However, since Rick obtained the time crystal by illegal means, the being tells them that they will go to Time Prison for eternity.After the being calls for backup, Rick tricks him and makes a grab for his 'gun' Chris , discarding and killing it. Rick orders Morty and Summer to remove their collars. He forces himself to be uncertain to split time once again. The three continue to split time in order to overwhelm the being, punching him across multiple timelines until he's defeated. As a consequence, time is now split across 64 different possibilities.Beth's surgery continues with all the characters gathered around her. Jerry comes to the rescue by bringing members of a Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose, Deer, and Stag. The members can transport the deer across state lines to the best doctors, and outside the jurisdiction of the hunter's claim. The two drive back into the woods with the Cervine Institute members and Jerry reveals that the two men were not from the Cervine Institute, but were actually employees at Cold Stone Creamery. This allows Beth to continue her operation. She successfully patches up the deer, who springs to life and returns to the woods.Rick, Morty, and Summer all attempt to put their collars on. Summer's works immediately, but due to a faulty Morty collar in one of the timelines (and Rick attempting to fix it), all of Morty and Rick's are still split. The broken-collared Morty attempts to hand the collar to Rick but with time destabilizing, falls into the black void. Rick dives after him, but Morty dropped his collar, so Rick gives Morty his collar. All Mortys are then safely teleported back. With one Rick floating in the spaceless void, he accepts death and tells Morty to be better than him. But then, Rick spots Morty's collar floating below him. He scrambles to collar while begging God for everything to work out. He fixes the collar, immediately denounces God, and then is teleported safely back with all others.

To the trio's shock, the hive mind apparently knows Rick, who awkwardly admits that he and the hive mind, named Unity, used to \"date.\"Back on the planet Unity overtook, Unity explains how it was able to take over the entire population, unifying the world and improving the quality of the inhabitants' life, at the cost of their free will and individuality. Despite being treated well by Unity, Summer protests the loss of the original population's individuality, but, as Unity controls every mind on the planet, her attempts to \"free\" the inhabitants do not go very far. Elsewhere on the planet, Unity and Rick waste no time rekindling their relationship rather extravagantly. Not long after, a neighboring hive mind called Beta-Seven arrives on a routine trading mission. Beta-Seven is ostensibly attempting to pursue a closer relationship with Unity, but its awkward efforts only cause Rick to make fun of it.

They soon begin bickering, to the point where the creature, fed up with the arguing, breaks free of his restraints, steals a translation device from the lab, and angrily explains the reason for his imprisonment and berates them both about how awful their marriage is, and then leaving, promising never to return to Earth.On Unity's planet, Morty and Summer try to get Rick to go home with them, but Rick dismisses them, sending them home via portal before continuing to party with Unity. At this point, Summer and Morty warn Unity and Rick about the terrible influence they have on each other and tell Unity to, \"take care of [itself]\".Later, when Rick leaves Unity to use the restroom, all the planet's inhabitants are gone, leaving behind farewell notes for Rick explaining that, while Unity enjoyed its time with him, they cannot be together; they are too alike in the sense that both of them turn others into mirror images of themselves, though in Rick's case, he does so through bad influence rather than assimilation. Unity mentions that Rick is even better at fulfilling what itself was destined to do through coming into existence as a hive-mind; that Rick is able to change others yet is not able to be reformed himself, which leads to his self-destructive, reckless nature eventually bringing those around him down with him and invariably sentences them to suffer because of his own emotional barriers and methods of resisting the inevitability of meaninglessness and his own pain.

After telling Rick that he'll remember him as a friend and unsatisfied, Rick retorts that he'll remember Morty as a \"whiny bitch\" citing that a minority of his memories of Morty were pleasant, and the majority were just pure annoyance. However, after listening to Ricks statement about good and bad memories, Morty has an epiphany and shoots Baby Wizard and Duck with Muscles. He explains to Rick that he found the tell-tale sign; the parasites were only capable of creating pleasant memories. So, he was able to know that Rick was real by all the terrible memories he had of him. Realizing Morty's theory was correct, Rick unlocks his armory and they both heavily arm themselves.Coming back into the house, Rick and Morty fire warning shots into the air and explain that they need to kill everyone that can only be remembered fondly. They begin by questioning Mrs. Refrigerator , who attempts to prove that she was in an unpleasant memory by passing off a roller-coaster ride as screaming torment. Beth tells Mrs. Refrigerator that rollercoasters are more thrilling than unpleasant and reminds her that she had be a perfect companion to her for her entire life. Mrs. Refrigerator goes into a panic, tries to claw her way through the blast shields and is shortly killed and exposed as a memory parasite. Rick questions Summer who is annoyed at the accusation being made against her. Morty then validates Summer's existence as he recalls her kicking him in the groin when she believed him of going into her room, despite Morty protesting his innocence while cringing on the ground. After being armed, Summer joins the two in questioning Beth. Summer then remembers when she asked her drunk mother to take her to school for picture day and was given a black eye when Beth accidentally hits her with a wine bottle. Beth kills a bear like parasite (who had compatible kidneys with her) and the Smiths kill the remaining parasites. As they kill parasites, Summer confirms Morty is real by remembering accidentally walking in on him masturbating in the kitchen. Beth kills Sleepy Gary, sending Jerry into a depression, asking Beth to kill him so they can be together in death. To her chagrin, Beth remembers a memory when Jerry was being chased by a feral homeless man with a broken bottle and locks himself inside the car, leaving Beth to fend for herself.Back downstairs, Rick comes across Pencilvester and has such fond \"memories\" of him, that he can't bring himself to kill him. Rick then asks Morty to kill Pencilvester. After killing Mr. Beauregard, Rick jokes thathedid the butler, though Ghost in a Jar is the only one who gets it. Rick thanks Ghost in a Jar before shooting him as well, and eventually all the parasites are destroyed.The family and Mr. Poopybutthole then sit down for dinner. Beth, being suspicious of the lack of bad memories of Mr. Poopybutthole, pulls out a ray gun and blasts him. However, instead of reverting into a parasite, Mr. Poopybutthole is blasted into a wall and begins bleeding from the wound in his torso. The family calls an ambulance, while Beth runs into the kitchen. Panicked, she pours a glass of wine with very shaky hands and downs it with eyes almost blinded with tears.The post-credits scene reveals that Mr. Poopybutthole is alive and recovering in physical therapy. The nurse informs the family that Mr. Poopybutthole does not wish to see them right now, and that he is \"sorry you didn't have bad memories of him\". As Jerry comforts Beth, Rick does one of his weird catchphrases.Mr. Poopybutthole was confirmed by Dan Harmon to have been a slightly different memory parasite than the ones that were shot and killed in the episode like Cousin Nicky . However, even without this confirmation, there are signs in the episode itself that Mr. Poopybutthole was a parasite. Mr. Poopybutthole is one of the many wacky and zany characters that are created out of nowhere in this episode. Mr. Poopybutthole shows up in the title sequence without explanation. Neither the Smith family nor viewers of the show have bad memories of Mr. Poopybutthole. The final scene where Beth shoots Mr. Poopybutthole can be explained as a memory created by Mr. Poopybutthole where again, Mr. Poopybutthole is not causing anyone else's pain. In the final scene where Mr. Poopybutthole is shot, again, Rick says a catchphrase that has never shown up in other episodes besides Total Rickall. These fake catchphrases seem to be invented by the memory parasites. Dan Harmon offered a theory in an interview that appears to match these events. Mr. Poopybutthole appears to breach the fourth wall in the ending of Total Rickall and future episodes where he appears by speaking directly to the viewers, implanting memories in the way a parasite would. This seems to suggest that the joke of the episode is that Mr. Poopybutthole has escaped the confines of the show and has escaped into the real world as a parasite in all of us."}, "15": {"title": "Get Schwifty (episode)", "text": "A massive alien head appears over the Earth, interfering with Earth's gravity and spawning several global disasters in the process. When the head exclaims, \"Show me what you got,\" Rick travels to The Pentagon to inform the President of the United States that the alien head is a Cromulon , and it seeks a live performance of a catchy new song.Unfortunately, an earthquake hit the Grammy Awards presentation, killing all of Earth's most famous musicians (including but not limited to Pharrell, Randy Newman, Billy Corgan, and The-Dream) with the exception of Ice-T who survived the earthquake. In desperation, Rick and Morty compose and perform the song \"Get Schwifty\". The head is pleased and transports the entire Earth to an intergalactic musical competition, viewed by more Cromulons, where the losers' planets are obliterated. Rick then tells the President that any astronauts they had in orbit at the time are dead.Rick and Morty team up with Ice-T to compose a new song, but Morty panics and steals Rick's portal device to save his family. Ice-T reveals himself to be a jaded alien and leaves Rick alone. Jerry, Beth, Summer and Ethan get involved with a religious cult whose beliefs are based on their interpretation of the actions of the Cromulons. Morty gets lost and traverses several portal openings, eventually stumbling onto Bird Person's world. Bird Person encourages Morty to have faith in Rick and sends him back to Earth.General Nathan ends up losing it, betrays the president, and launches nuclear bombs at the host Cromulon as he was wanting to do the whole episode, however this barely effects him and in reply, he simply states''BOO, NOT COOL!''and he disqualifies Earth, but Ice-T returns and saves the planet from annihilation. Rick and Morty, back together again, perform a new hit song, satisfy the Cromulons, and win the contest. Nathan runs at the president with an M16 after all is saved, but Rick turns him into a snake. Meanwhile, the alien head cult quickly disbands after realizing it was all just a musical reality show.In the post-credits, Ice-T returns to his planet upon his exile and is restored to his Water-T form. When the Numbericons attack with his father Helium-Q getting killed by a falling debris, Water-T leads the Alphabetrium inhabitants into fighting the Numbericons ."}, "16": {"title": "The Ricks Must Be Crazy", "text": "Rick, Morty, and Summer exit out a theater showcasing a Ball Fondlers movie. They go towards the ship while Rick explains the pros and cons in the universe. When Rick attempts to start the engine, he realizes the car battery is dead. He and Morty travel to the microverse while Summer stays in the ship as it is given the instructions by Rick to \"keep Summer safe\".As an intimidating man with a tough appearance in a white shirt approaches Summer , she becomes uncomfortable. After becoming upset, showing he has a short temper, due to him believing Summer thinks she's better than him, the man is then violently cut into many pieces by the ship's arm and laser. Immediately after, a skinnier man appears on the scene in shock of what happened to his friend. He is then picked up by another arm, but is spared from death as Summer pleas for the ship to not murder him. He is then shot in the back by a weaker laser which paralyses him from the waist down. Summer is mortified by the sight.Rick and Morty then warp to their cube ship. Rick explains to Morty how the microverse was created. After Rick and Morty have a conversation about the concept of the microverse and Morty calling the concept slavery with extra steps, they land to be greeted by the microverse's inhabitants. Rick flips the inhabitants off, then explains to Morty that the gesture's meaning is \"peace among worlds\". Rick and Morty then encounter President Chris who tells them that Zeep Zanflorp invented a new technology that makes the Gooble Boxes obsolete, much to Rick's displeasure. The President then says \"Fuck you\" that makes Rick momentarily upset until he clarifies that Rick said that \"fuck you\" meant \"much obliged\". Rick, Morty and the President then make their way to Zeep Tower where they meet Zeep. Zeep pretends to not remember Rick from his previous encounters with the miniverse's people, which offends Rick. Zeep then introduces the trio to the miniverse that Rick instantly dislikes as it is much like his idea for the microverse. After being persuaded by the President, Zeep allows Rick and Morty to enter his miniverse that was created almost exactly like how the microverse was. After Zeep explains the story of his invention, Rick criticizes him similar to how Morty did Rick. After Morty pulls Rick to have a conversation about Rick's hypocrisy, Rick gets the idea to meet another scientist with a similar idea to both Rick and Zeep's at which point Zeep will have to make the point that microverse technology is bad, thus forcing the microverse's people to return to the Gooble Box and powering Rick's car.When Zeep is giving a speech to the miniverse's inhabitants, Rick then asks the President about scientists working on projects similar to the microverse. When Zeep finishes flashing a V-shaped hand gesture and telling Morty that he told the people of the miniverse that it meant \"peace among worlds\", Rick gets Morty and Zeep to meet Kyle . Kyle explains the concept behind his project that is similar to the microverse and miniverse's. However, unlike the two, the teenyverse is not advanced to the point of supporting complicated societies. When he gets the gist of Kyle's invention, Zeep gets on Kyle for making something that's amoral but as he's lecturing Kyle, Zeep realizes that Rick created his universe. When confronted by Zeep, Rick begins to fight Zeep. On the side lines, Kyle begins to realize that Rick created Zeep's universe who created Kyle's universe which then reminds Kyle about how he couldn't make it to his father's funeral due to him working too much on his project. Not noticing how devastated Kyle was, instead of comforting him, Morty begins to make cracks about how science is a real \"mistress\" and only realizes the severity of Kyles mental state when he commits suicide by flying his cube ship into a nearby mountain side, leaving everyone else trapped in the teenyverse. The surviving three then live in two separate cave-like holes in mountains with Rick and Morty living in one and Zeep alone in the other. Morty suggest that they work together to get out of the teenyverse, but Rick and Zeep refuse to cooperate. The two scientists then start to have a feud, causing Morty to finally lose patience and leave Rick so he can live with the tree people.Months later in the teenyverse, Rick and Zeep both have advanced technology and continue their struggle against each other. As Rick and Zeep have an equally match battle destroying both of their mech-like wooden suits, the tree people surround them with Morty as their leader (although Morty disagrees and says that they have no leader). Morty then guides the two rivals to Kuala, the spirit tree. But as soon as he notices the rest of the tree people aren't listening, he tells Rick that he's been driven to near madness as the tree people are vile, unsanitary savages who eat their own children because they believe it makes their trees bear larger fruit. Morty confesses that he missed his home and had become so desperate for sexual relief that he masturbated to the sight of a particularly curvy piece of driftwood. Finally, Morty declares that he's done waiting around and tells Rick and Zeep that they're going to put aside their feud and create the technology necessary to get them home. Naturally, Rick and Zeep once again begin coming up with excuses not to work together. This time, however, Morty doesn't take \"no\" for an answer and orders the tree people to force Rick and Zeep to work with each other. As they do so, Rick and Zeep begin to grow a bond as they work on the project over their similarities (such as Zeep comparing Ricks alcoholism to his own opioid addiction). Before the two succeed and warp themselves out of the teenyverse, Morty turns to the tree people and tells them all off, saying, \"You guys are the fucking worst! Your gods are a lie! Fuck you, fuck nature, and fuck trees!\". Returning to Kyle's lab, Rick asks Zeep about the drinks he promised back at their makeshift lab. Zeep slowly walks backwards into an elevator to try and escape, but Rick puts his foot in the doors. Zeep kicks Rick out and rushes up the elevator, prompting Rick and Morty to have a great race with Zeep to Rick's ship, ending with Rick and Morty arriving at the ship (and Rick admitting to Morty that he secretly implanted him with chip and injected his blood stream with nano-bots that gave him the power to turn into a car). After one final fight between Rick and Zeep with Rick winning, Rick and Morty exit the battery and go out for ice cream with a greatly-traumatized Summer. Upon getting the ice cream, however, Rick discovers that the ice cream made has flies put into it due to the treaty, which leads to an argument between Rick and Summer about if the change was the ship's fault or not. Outside, the spider queen can be seen peacefully enjoying her ice cream while hanging from a thread of web.Summer cowers in fear as the police approach her and the ship. The ship then calls out a number of weapons, but as Summer commands the ship to cause no one any harm, the ship calls off its weapons. An armed officer nears the ship with two other armed officers. After scanning the first officer, the ship then sends out a capsule that rolls towards the police. It opens to reveal a child named Hunter, the late son of the center officer, who died at the age of only 7 years old after being drowned in a swimming pool. The center officer then approaches his son and commands the police to cease fire as he talks with his son. Hunter then asks his father to leave Summer alone shortly before dissipating into a pinkish liquid. The ship makes a final threat that then wards off the officers, horrifying Summer even further.Military backup is then summoned to the site of Summer and the ship. The ship notifies Summer about how it is clearly capable of repelling the military but Summer authorizes it to prevent any harm. Summer and the ship have a small argument that ends with the ship mocking Summer for her teen girl talk. The General begins a countdown for Summer to leave the vehicle or else she will face open fire, but as a final stand, the ship creates a peace treaty between the giant spiders and humanity the President of the United States and a giant spider queen start.In the post-credit scene, Morty begins falling asleep in class, but he accidentally activates his ability to transform into a car and crushes a girl in front of him. Everyone in class looks at the accident as Car Morty is slightly ashamed of himself."}, "17": {"title": "Big Trouble in Little Sanchez", "text": "While eating breakfast, Jerry asks his children Summer and Morty if anything interesting is happening at school. Morty responds, after thinking for a moment, that one of the lunch ladies was found dead, her body drained of blood and marked by two holes in her neck. Beth's horror, as she has no idea how such a horrible thing could happen, is quickly quenched by a nonchalant Rick, who reveals that vampires are real; the revelation horrifies Summer, but Rick casually tells her that humanity has known of their existence for hundreds of years. Terrified of the possibility of being killed by a vampire, Summer desperately asks to grandpa Rick if he could go to their school by transferring his consciousness into the body of a teenager, which Rick considers a stupid idea and insults Summer for it. Beth tries to get Jerry to support Summer, but Jerry is too distracted by his tablet to pay attention, leading to a conflict. Rick grows tired of their fights and declares that he will take them to off-planet therapy to fix their relationship.At school Morty and Summer discuss how best to deal with the vampire issue when they are greeted by \" Tiny Rick \": Rick decided to help them out by putting himself into high-school aged clone of himself temporarily. After killing the vampire (who as it turns out was Coach Feratu ), Tiny Rick heads home to transfer his mind into the older Rick's body, which is stored in a vat in the garage. However, Summer gets a text from Toby Matthews asking if they could have a party at the Smith house, but wants to have Tiny Rick there as well. Tiny Rick decides to stay in his younger body to let Morty and Summer have a party. At the party Tiny Rick performs a song on his guitar, the lyrics of which sound like desperate pleas from the older Rick to get him out of Tiny Rick's body, but nobody notices except Summer, who realizes something odd is happening. Tiny Rick quickly becomes popular with the rest of the school, in turn increasing Morty and Summer's social standing, but Summer becomes increasingly worried that Rick has become trapped in his young body. Morty initially ignores her as Jessica has begun talking to him as a direct result of Tiny Rick, but his suspicions are raised when Rick's dance solo at the school dance includes lyrics practically begging someone to help him return to his old body. Unwilling to let this continue, Summer hides the wooden stakes they used to kill Coach Feratu in Tiny Rick's locker, resulting in his expulsion. Tiny Rick turns the entire school (including Toby Matthews) on Summer. Morty finally has enough, and he and Summer sneak up on Tiny Rick just as he is trying to destroy Rick's original body and they force him to listen to Elliot Smith music. Rick's emotional reaction to the music allows him to break free of his younger self's control, and he gets his grandkids to transfer his mind back to his older body. Once this is finished, he heads down to his underground lair and brutally destroys his other younger clones, with a newfound respect for his current age.After Rick drops off (or rather abandons) Beth and Jerry at therapy, they are greeted by Glexo Slim Slom . Glexo puts Jerry into a helmet attached to a machine that creates Jerry's perception of Beth , a monstrous creature. Beth is immediately offended by this, telling Jerry to take it back. Beth then puts on the helmet, creating a weak, worm version of Jerry . Jerry is also upset by Beth's perception of him. Glexo then leads the couple and other visitors on a tour of the facility, where all the couples' perceptions are kept in cages. The idea behind the therapy is that the perceptions are not the real marriages and that they are all safe from the perceptions. However, in a major disaster, Beth's mytholog manipulates Jerry's mytholog into helping her escape, and she rampages through the facility, killing staff and visitors alike. Glexo angrily informs Jerry and Beth that this is a sign that their relationship has become co-dependent, and the truth is neither of them should ever have gotten married (to which Jerry and Beth declare this is just bad couple's therapy). When the evacuation results in Jerry and Beth being left behind in the facility, Beth gets kidnapped by her own mytholog and attached to one of the machines to make more of her pathetic Jerrys. Beth questions why not just have Jerry make more Beths, but her mytholog replies that in Jerry's mind there can only be one true Beth. Jerry, encountering his own mytholog, grows frustrated that this is Beth's perception of who he really is and heroically comes to rescue her, causing Beth to create heroic Jerry mythologs who help Jerry in his fight (only to start making narcissistic Jerrys when she gets annoyed with his self-indulgent monologue). Just when it looks like they are losing the battle with the Beth mytholog Jerry has the idea to attach the helmet to one of his strong selves, creating Goddess Beth who destroys the monster, ending the fight. As the Jerry mythologs bow down to their goddess, the real Beth and Jerry reconcile.In the epilogue, a vampire reports to the Vampire Master that Coach Feratu was destroyed. The master is flabbergasted that he named his alias after a famous vampire movie and makes a new rule: no more \"clever name bullshit\"."}, "18": {"title": "Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate", "text": "After eating from a pint of Cherry Garcia ice cream which actually contained a dangerous mutant bacteria that was in the second freezer drawer (which belongs to Rick ), Jerry is rushed to St. Gloopy Noops Hospital , an institution in space, by his family. While waiting for the results of Jerry's treatment, Rick, Beth , Summer , and Morty sit in the hospital's waiting room. Unwilling to watch QCV (an alien version of QVC), Rick jury-rigs the cable box with his inter-dimensional crystal. After smashing the cable box and hooking up the crystal, a nurse asks him what he is doing to which Rick replies, \"A sequel.\" After watching \" Man vs. Car \" (a competition pitting men against cars in a gladiatorial ring) and a commercial for \"Eyeholes\" (a cereal protected diligently by a spandex-clad alien with a megaphone ), a distraught Beth sits down with them in the waiting room.Jerry wakes in his hospital room, cured of his bacterial infection. His doctor, accompanied by a number of others, explains that the galaxy's most influential civil rights leader, Shrimply Pibbles , is in the same hospital dying; he can be saved, however, if Jerry donates his sexual organs to Pibbles to act as a heart. An elderly alien in a wheelchair arrives, and he expresses his doubt that Jerry will help him, as his significant experience of creating documentaries around Earth culture is built around sex. Upset by the notion, Jerry agrees to donate his organs in an attempt to redeem Earth's reputation.After a brief remark by Morty about an odd-looking woman getting coffee, Rick turns to \" How Did I Get Here? \", and Morty discovers that the odd woman has disappeared from the waiting room, having suddenly reappeared on top of a streetlamp in the show. The entire family is perplexed by the occurrence, and Rick advises them to \"stay away from the coffee machine.\" They then watch an ad for \" Jan Quadrant Vincent 16 \" (an action-adventure starring several copies of Jan Michael Vincent).Jerry, in the meantime, is having second thoughts about donating to Pibbles, and he tells his doctor that he wants to consult with Beth before moving forward with the surgery. After the rest of the family watches \" The Adventures of Stealy \" and \" Funny Songs \", the doctor comes into the waiting room and addresses the family, telling them that Jerry is fine, but also asking the Beth come with him. After Jerry tells her about the surgery, the conversation among Beth, Jerry and the doctor spirals downward, but upon reading the catalog of highly advanced prosthetics Jerry can be given to replace his missing organs, Beth decides to let Jerry choose for himself. Still not willing to say no, Jerry concedes.As the family watches \" Lil' Bits \" (a commercial for a restaurant with minuscule food portions), Jerry is given the chance to \"use\" his organs one last time, as the doctor leaves him in his office with alien pornography and a towel. Not aroused by the videos, Jerry discovers that the doctor has left Pibbles' medical records open behind the windows of porn; the doctor then re-enters the room and tells Jerry as much, asking him to use discretion. Jerry does not, but instead examines the medical records and finds a piece of information that he believes will allow him to keep his sexual organs.Watching \"Opposite News with Michael Thompson\" and \"Cooking Things with Pichael Thompson\", the family soon discovers that the two hosts are conjoined twins , shooting their shows simultaneously side-by-side. Rick remarks to Summer that she \"has no idea how much that must save production.\" The hospital meanwhile holds a news conference to announce that Pibbles can be saved, and also to introduce Jerry, the donor responsible for the opportunity. When Jerry, speaking to the very large crowd, mentions Pibbles' \"ongoing battle with heroin dependency\", the crowd applauds enthusiastically. A confused Jerry inquires as to whether or not the heroin issue was a matter of public record, to which a few upset reporters reply that heroin comprised ten percent of the atmosphere of Pibbles' home planet\u2014at least, before it was destroyed by Klargon death squads, which rendered him unable to breathe without heroin. The entire audience boos Jerry, realizing that he is trying to keep from losing his member.Rick, Summer, and Morty watch an episode of \" How They Do It \" (which details the manufacturing process behind the plumbus) and \"The Personal Space Show\" (hosted by a man obsessed with keeping his personal space unoccupied, even by his own skin)\u2014which is followed by an advert for \"The Northsiders\"\u2014before finding an alien athletic competition. At the press conference, one of the doctors quiets the furious crowd, announcing that large numbers of people, having heard of Jerry's double-cross and wanting to save Pibbles, have donated enough money to purchase a synthetic heart for him. Jerry, upset and offended, begins to think of a way to regain his honor. Later, as the surgery begins, Jerry bursts into the operating room wielding a pistol-like apparatus, demanding that they cut off his member and use it to save Pibbles.Rick, Summer, and Morty, in the meantime, watch \"Octopus Man\" , a clip that ends with the main character needlessly stabbing two random people to death on the street. Summer voices opposition to unnecessary violence in television, and Morty responds by yelling that her views on television are primitive. Beth arrives, telling them that they can leave, but a news report suddenly breaks through, announcing that Jerry is holding the doctors hostage. Discovering that the holdup is not happening in another dimension, Beth and Summer rush to the scene, where Jerry is in a standoff with two armed guards; demanding to know what is going on, Jerry only replies, \"I'm a good person.\" Beth then realizes that the thing Jerry is holding is not a gun, but one of the highly advanced vibrators from the catalog. Out of options, Jerry pulls down his pants and runs at Pibbles' body, tearfully reasserting that he is \"a good person\". The guards open fire on Jerry, shooting him fifty-seven times as the entire family screams in horror (Rick and Morty watch the events unfold on the television); they continue to shoot him even after his mangled, lifeless body falls to the floor.Some time later, Jerry awakens to an advertisement for \"Butthole Ice Cream Parlor\" . Realizing he is awake, Beth tells him that everything he remembers really happened, and that since they were at an alien hospital, repairing his body was, in Beth's words, \"like getting a splinter removed.\" Jerry says that all he wanted was for people to like him, not hate him, and Beth responds that \"You can't make people like you. You just have to wait for hating you to bore them.\" Rising from his bed, Jerry declares his intent to go to the zoo with his family, but they angrily shoot him down.In a post-credits scene, Jerry sneaks into Rick's cupboard and tries to steal his Eyeholes cereal to eat from it only to be immediately assaulted by the furious Eyehole Man. Summer and Morty work to get the Eyehole Man off of Jerry as Rick puts the box back in his cupboard while reprimanding Jerry for going through his part of the cupboard. Morty quotes \"Why do you even have those?\""}, "19": {"title": "Look Who's Purging Now", "text": "While flying through space, Rick and Morty collide with an interstellar insect which smears on the windshield; when Rick attempts to clean it, the windshield becomes even more smeared, and Rick decides to search for washer fluid on a nearby planet. Upon arriving, Rick discovers that the citizens of the planet sustain their peaceful way of life by engaging in open warfare on one night every year; upon discovering that the aforementioned night (which the citizens call \"The Festival\") is that very evening, Rick pleasantly proposes to Morty that they stay and observe the murderous rite.They succeed in finding wiper fluid, and they depart as the sun sets, flying low over the surface of the planet as the Festival begins. Rick's enthusiasm for the Festival is quickly crushed by a particularly gruesome death, which sprays copious amounts of blood onto his windshield. As he vomits out his window, thoroughly disgusted by the sight, Morty sees a girl in trouble and demands of Rick that they save her; when Rick objects, Morty blackmails him into complying. Upon landing (on top of one of the girl's attackers), Rick enthusiastically begins shooting everybody who comes near them. Morty suggests that the girl, Arthricia , wait out the Festival in their ship, and Rick sarcastically agrees.At the Smith house , Jerry and Summer get into an argument over Jerry's pointless conversation, and Jerry leaves the room while being heckled by Summer.Arthricia asks Morty to stop asking her questions about The Festival, leading to an awkward silence. The girl suddenly screams that she has forgotten about her grandmother; the group travels to a ramshackle farmhouse, where, despite his misgivings, Rick follows Arthricia inside. She then double-crosses them: she overpowers Rick, steals his gun and shoots him with it, finally coercing Morty to surrender the ship. Apologizing to him, she flies away into the night, struggling with the controls. Moving inside the cabin, now on fire, Morty finds Rick wounded on the floor, and helps him out of the shack. A group of people advance on them; when Rick disintegrates one of them, however, they surrender and give him their weapons.Summer and Jerry begin to renew their argument, but before they can do so, the \"space phone\" Rick gave them rings, and Summer retrieves it from its somewhat forgotten place between the sofa cushions. Hiding out in a shack with Morty and in the process of creating a chemical solution to heal his wound, Rick gives them the details of their situation and, between dispatching people bursting into the cabin and Jerry asking if the person on the phone is Taddy Mason , he dictates a number to Summer. After killing the last intruder with a spoon (the only thing Morty threw to Rick when he asked for help) and berating Morty for throwing him \"the one thing that can never kill anything\", Rick tells Summer to find a red box over his workbench, take it outside, and enter the aforementioned number into the box.To set up a beacon for what Rick identifies only as a \"package\", Rick and Morty head toward a lighthouse, intending to assemble the beacon on the observation platform. However, the owner of the lighthouse consents only on the condition that one of them listens to a story of his. While Rick heads to the top of the lighthouse, Morty agrees to listen to the story, which he discovers is not only a movie script but is absolutely atrocious. To pass the time, he decides to eat one of the two candy bars given to them by the person who gave them the wiper fluid.Summer and Jerry go to the garage, where Summer retrieves the red box and places it on the floor, berating Jerry for his insistence on resolving his issue as she inputs the numbers into the box. Upon the completion of the sequence, the box pops open, forming a launchpad for a large, silvery orb with a smaller red dot on its side. As Jerry continues trying to restore his dignity, the orb hurls itself through the ceiling into the sky, leading Summer to muse, \"Oh...he might have said to take it outside.\"On the observation deck, Rick finishes assembling the receiver, while down in the main room, the owner finishes reading to Morty, whose patience is wearing thin. After repeatedly asking Morty for his honest opinion, Morty says he has a problem with the way the story begins with a flash back teaser, and the owner, suddenly offended, responds by ordering them to leave. Morty becomes confused and the owner claims that he shared something personal with him and he, \"took a giant shit on it\". Morty becomes offended by the attacks against his character and tells the owner that they just asked to set up a beacon. The owner tells Morty that they no longer can do so because Morty is a, \"shitty person and insecure\" and mounts the stairs. Upon reaching the top, he tells Rick to leave claiming that Morty is a, \"shitty person\". Morty quickly defends himself by claiming that he, \"sat through\" the entire screen play, further infuriating the owner. Fed up with the owners insecurities, Morty reveals that he hated the entire story. Rick reminds Morty that they're guests, Morty retorts that he tried to behave himself but the owner dragged his anger out. When the owner tries to shut the receiver down himself, Morty stops him, claiming that he's not a bad person just because the owner is insecure about his writing and pushes him down the flight of stairs in a fit of rage, killing him and leaving Rick astonished.Jerry again tries to reconnect with Summer by recalling memories of the past, but the conversation devolves into a plea for money by Jerry. Summer leaves him in the garage by himself, and a piece of the shattered roof falls on his head, just after he utters \"...Guess this is what rock bottom feels like\"..Leaving the lighthouse, a horde of rioters confronts them, including the man who gave them the wiper fluid and candy bars. Before a fight can break out, however, the orb-like probe lands between Rick and Morty and assembles suits of weaponized flying armor onto their bodies. Rick immediately begins to slaughter the mob. At first, Morty is hesitant, but he soon finds his, \"inner rage\" and slaughters the entire mob (as his suit plays \"Feels Good\" by Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9!). Rick congratulates Morty on finding the ability to purge and they looking for their ship. Rick succeeds in finding it, crashed into the side of a building, but turns around to find Morty once again slaughtering every person in sight, even those who are hiding; even once every one has been killed, Morty continues firing round after round into long-dead bodies even as Rick gently ushers him back toward the ship.Reaching the ship, they find Arthricia crawling on the ground nearby. As they train their weapons on her, she explains her true intentions: to use the ship to murder the arrogant rich people who force the peasants to fight to the death. Morty, drunk with rage, insists on killing Arthricia on the spot, but Rick tells Morty to calm down. Morty then threatens to kill Rick, at which point Rick tasers Morty to get him under control and asks Arthricia where the rich people are.At a mansion outside of town, the planet's wealthy make a dinner toast to another successful year of The Festival, which has been going on for thousands of years. Moments later, the sound of \" Feels Good \" floats through the air, and Arthricia, now wearing Morty's power suit, and Rick, with Morty tied to his back, break down the door. Rick tells the rich people that he has nothing against them, but that Arthricia is deeply offended by their forcing the peasants to kill each other while suffering no consequence themselves. He further explains that Arthricia's suit of power armor is a way of fairly apportioning power among them. Arthricia then begins to exact her revenge, slaughtering the rich people and inviting Rick to join in the bloodbath. Rick initially refuses, saying the killing has become \"gratuitous\", but eventually joins in after being asked a second time. After killing all the rich people, Rick and Arthricia ecstatically dance to \"Feels Good\".As the sun rises in the morning, Morty finally wakes at the ship. After being encouraged by Rick, Morty goes over to talk to Arthricia, who spurns him by saying that she has a boyfriend.As Rick and Morty are preparing to leave, the townsfolk discuss building a new society from the ground up, and Rick suggests using food to barter. After Rick and Morty leave, the discussion about food escalates into a bloody brawl. One of the townsfolk stops the brawl and explains a plan for stopping the violence, which stabilizes the basic concept of The Festival within the society.On their way back to Earth, Morty reflects on his rage-fueled rampage with shame. Rick assures him that none of his actions were his fault and that the cause of his violent rage was due to eating the candy bar, which contained Purgenol , a chemical that amplifies a person's violent tendencies. Rick convinces Morty that, despite what happened the previous night, nothing about who he was has changed. As Rick throws his candy bar in the back seat, the candy bar's wrapper faces up, revealing a sticker that reads \"Now Purgenol-Free\".In the post-credits scene, Beth asks Jerry why their phone bill is $700 and inquires as to what \"Taddy Mason, L.L.C.\" stands for. Soon, a Taddy Mason commercial plays on the television, which explains that it is a dial-a-friend pay service with a callback option. Beth soaks in this information while Jerry tries in desperation to shut off their television. After he finally unplugs the T.V., Beth bluntly tells Jerry to \"get a job\"."}, "20": {"title": "The Wedding Squanchers", "text": " Rick , Morty , Beth , Summer and Jerry are eating breakfast, with Beth once more telling Jerry to get a job, when there is a knock on the door. A \"Courier Flap\" arrives, an organism servicing as an intergalactic mail service, with Birdperson's invitation to his wedding to Tammy on Planet Squanch . Rick immediately declines, saying that weddings always make people miserable (or, in his words, \"funerals with cake\"). While Beth attempts to convince Rick to attend his friend's special event, Jerry manages to be accidentally transported via the courier to the planet, forcing a reluctant Rick to bring the rest of the family to the wedding.The family arrives with Squanchy greeting them, and the Smith Family (minus Rick) mingle with the numerous guests; Jerry unsuccessfully tries to joke with Tammy's parents, Beth inquires about Rick with Birdperson, who discloses vague and dark parts of his and Rick's past, and Morty protests to Rick about opening up more and enjoying the wedding.Tammy reveals herself as a Galactic Federation agent.Birdperson and Tammy are wed, and Rick reluctantly follows Morty's advice to open up by giving an ad-libbed wedding toast about love and his happiness the newly married couple. Unfortunately, the happiness ends when the bride reveals herself to be a deep undercover Galactic Federation agent, and that the building is surrounded by officers. When the reception erupts into chaos, Birdperson is shot multiple times and seemingly killed, much to Rick's horror. As the majority of the criminals attending the wedding are gunned down, Rick is about to use his portal gun when Tammy ambushes him and holds him at gunpoint, ordering him to give up the gun. He does so, although he also wires it to kill several Galactic Federation officers and explode before it is able to be recovered. Consequently, the explosion also renders Tammy temporarily deaf. As the final few shots are fired from those still living, Squanchy provides a diversion for the family to escape by drinking a potion and turning into a large warrior, temporarily fighting off the surviving Galactic Federation goons and avenging many of his allies' deaths.Following the chaos at the wedding, an angered Rick reveals that he is vehemently against the Federation, enough to join forces with the late Birdperson and other like-minded rebels. Despite Beth's suggestion to return home, Rick points out that option is no longer possible, as Earth will be the first place for the Federation to look for him. He even goes as far as to say that if any of them were to go home themselves, they could be interrogated despite not knowing where Rick might escape to.Instead, he suggests finding a new world to live in. Upon asking his computer, he finds out that there are 765 planets similar to Earth in the Milky Way with only 3 existing outside federal jurisdiction. They find a very similar Earth-like planet but also find that it is incredibly small. They then find a much larger planet where everything from the plants to even the animal life is \"on a cob\". However, Rick panics from this discovery and quickly takes everyone back out. The last Federation-free planet seems almost perfect (and \"cob-free\"), until they discover a sun that screams endlessly throughout the planet's 42-hour day. With only this and the small Earth as their only options, they decide to return to the small Earth.While hiding on the small Earth, the Smiths learn from a news broadcast that the Federation have occupied Earth in an attempt to find them, and ultimately Rick. As Rick explores a cave leading under the house, he overhears the rest of his family arguing about what to do with their predicament. Jerry suggests turning Rick in, with the main reason of him caring about no one but himself. Everyone else, especially Beth, are willing to put up with Rick's antics and sacrifice their current and future lives on earth so they don't have to lose him, with Summer arguing that you don't love someone in the hopes of a reward and Morty reiterating Birdperson's response to him seeking to abandon Rick during the Armageddon, refuting Jerry by convicting that the family will stick beside Rick even if he wouldn't do the same for them. Upon hearing his family defend him and Beth eventually break down and emotionally confess that she is scared of being abandoned by him again, Rick realizes that despite treating his family badly in the past, they're willing to sacrifice their lives and futures on earth to be with him. This causes him to guiltily reflect on the fact that he's a selfish and destructive person, eventually leading him to have a defining moment in which he decides to turn himself in to the Galactic Federation. Saying goodbye to Morty under the guise of an ice cream run, he flies to a nearby cantina to await his own arrest. En route to the cantina, Rick poses as Jerry to tip off the Galactic Federation on where Rick can be found while asking for his family to be spared where it turns out that the Smiths are not wanted by the Federation.The Smiths are escorted back to Earth, now a Galactic Federation protectorate. Jerry is happy when a robotic agent tells him to report to the employment office to be \"assigned a function\" in order to pay off a debt of 7,000 credits for antidepressant pills, although Morty and the rest of the family seem ill at ease.Rick is booked and incarcerated in a maximum-security Federation prison, seemingly without bail or parole. A fellow prisoner asks him what he did. \"Everything,\" Rick glumly replies.In a post-credits scene, Mr. Poopybutthole is seen in his apartment watching the show, breaking the 4th wall. He turns off the set, limps over to a table, and, while chipperly addressing the viewers, swallows an inordinate amount of painkillers, noting they are to treat the lingering pain from when Beth shot him in Total Rickall . He then pesters a pizza delivery guy at the door about the show and what his favorite part was, but the delivery man has no idea what he is talking about. Mr. Poopybutthole then tells the viewers to tune in to Season Three to see what how the \"mess\" Rick is in unravels."}, "21": {"title": "The Rickshank Rickdemption", "text": "The episode starts out with Rick and his family sitting in a booth at an old fashioned American diner, Shoney's , talking about Rick's escape from space prison.

The agent makes it clear that Rick's brain will be liquefied at the end of the session, so he might as well revisit his memories one last time.Summer finds the portal gun.Meanwhile, Morty and his family are back on Earth, which is now being run by the Galactic Federation. Jerry now works\u00a0an unspecified occupation, while Beth has lost her own job due to the Federation's advanced medical knowledge. Unhappy with their current way of life, Summer decides to save Rick and digs up the portal gun buried by Rick in the backyard next to his own alternate-dimension corpse. Morty tries to dissuade Summer from doing so, but when the family's robot butler Conroy turns hostile and attempts to confiscate the portal gun, Morty transports them all to his\u00a0\" Cronenberg World \"\u00a0family, which he and Rick C-137 abandoned previously.Morty's original family, and his replacement Summer in the background.After they arrive, Conroy is destroyed by Jerry Smith and Summer Smith from the abandoned Prime Dimension .

The cataclysm endured by this dimension affords Morty the proof to Summer that Rick does not care about anyone, especially his family. At this point, Jerry smashes the portal gun, preventing our Summer and Morty from leaving.A sham trial.Agents from the Council of Ricks show up to investigate the compromised portal gun, immobilizing Jerry, Beth, and the other Summer with a freeze ray. As Summer informs the agents that Rick C-137 has been captured, the agents dispatch a Rick Council Seal Team to assassinate Rick C-137, while Summer and Morty are captured. At the subsequent kangaroo court aboard the Citadel of Ricks , our Summer and Morty speak out against the council in Rick C-137's defense, and Morty reveals that he never gave up on Rick and was just trying to protect his sister from the dangers of life with Rick involved.Beth and Diane.Back in the brain-link simulation, Rick stops by a McDonalds drive-thru, and orders Chicken McNuggets with Szechuan sauce . Rick then shows the agent a memory of how he lost his wife and Beth to an explosion in his first dimension , driving him to invent his first portal gun. The agent collects what he believes to be the genuine portal gun formula and uploads it to the brain-link server. The agent then attempts to leave the brain-link, but his communication device fails. Rick reveals that the \"code\" given was actually a virus giving him control of the entire system and that the \"memory\" they visited was a \"fabricated\" origin story. Rick then transfers his consciousness out of the brain-link into the physical body of the agent.At this point, the Rick Council Seal Team shows up and kills all of the aliens and Rick D-99 , a SEAL Team Member shoots Rick C-137\u2019s old body in the head, destroying it. Rick manages to transfer his consciousness from his agent body to Rick D-99. Quickly afterward, another SEAL Team Rick shoots the agent body, killing Rick D-99. Rick C-137 (in his new body) kills the rest of the agents and interrogates a surviving Rick, which the surviving Rick tells him that Morty and Summer are on the Citadel. Rick thanks the last surviving Rick and shoots him in the head.Rick transports the Citadel into the Galactic Federation Prison.Rick rappels up a rope and leaves the Galactic Federation Prison and makes his way to the teleportation control room of the Citadel of Ricks by switching his consciousness into a high ranking Rick. He teleports the entire Citadel back into the middle of the federation prison, resulting in a heated battle between the two sides. Rick C-137 infiltrates the Council chamber and kills most of the Council of Ricks before ending up in a standoff with the final member, attempting to use Summer as a hostage.With a clever bit of trickery, Rick and Morty combine efforts to save Summer and escape back to Earth, but not before Rick returns to the prison's control room and changes the Galactic Federation's currency, Blemflarcks , so that 1 blemflarck is worth 0 blemflarcks. With the economy in shambles, the Federation follows suit, sending the whole galaxy into chaos and resulting in many aliens leaving Earth.Rick or Jerry.By the time Rick, Morty and Summer return home, Jerry is once again unemployed while Beth is simply relieved that her family is home safe and sound. Unhappy with his father-in-law's return, Jerry demands that Beth chooses between himself and Rick, leading to the two deciding on divorce.All he wants is that Szechuan Chicken McNugget Sauce.Once Beth and Summer leave the garage, Rick reveals to Morty that he had himself captured on purpose in order to take revenge on both the Galactic Federation and Jerry for crossing him. By eliminating Jerry, Rick now takes on the role as the undisputed patriarch of the family, and Morty will be forced to continue on adventures with him as both Beth and Summer view Rick as a hero. Rick explains that all he wants out of all his plans is to get Szechuan Chicken McNugget Sauce , which was discontinued by McDonalds years ago. Understandably, Morty is visibly horrified by the revelation.

Beth comes into the garage looking for Morty and Summer but promptly leaves after seeing Jerry . As Jerry pathetically stands outside the house, the wind quietly calls him a loser.The leader begs Summer to kill him, to which she coldly agrees.Rick's portal takes him and his grandchildren to a diesel-fueled post-apocalyptic Earth, filled with dieselpunk cars, shotguns, mutants, and cannibals. Rick's main goal is to retrieve the powerful Isotope-322, but the adventure is sidetracked by Summer becoming enamored by this dimension, killing the leader of the Death Stalkers and forming an alliance with them. Though Rick and Morty initially want to go home, Rick sees the Death Stalkers have a large rock-form of Isotope-322 and decides to stick around so he can steal it.Morty is not handling his parents' divorce well.While Summer goes off to kill some people, Rick tries to get Morty to make a distraction by being a ringer in the Thunderdome (or Blood Dome, as the Death-Stalkers call it). Rick inserts a serum that extracts muscle memory from body parts into Morty's arm to give him combat skills, but \"muscle memory\" apparently includes the memories and personality of said body-parts, giving Morty a left arm with enormous strength that punches Rick before beating up and killing various Death Stalkers in the Blood Dome. Though Morty initially does this against his will, he soon begins venting his frustrations against Jerry for agreeing to the divorce through the arm. Rick tries to get Morty and Summer to leave before the Death-Stalkers notice someone stole the Isotope-322, and Morty's arm reveals the theft, forcing Rick to pull out his laser gun , telling the viewer that they will be right back.Summer and Morty chase Rick.The episode continues with Rick being chased by his grandchildren in separate cars. He tries to convince them that they are merely staying in the world because they do not want to confront their parents' divorce, but ultimately gives up and portals back to his garage, leaving Morty and Summer trapped (albeit willingly) with the Death Stalkers.Summer and Hemorrhage hook up.While in the Blood Dome, Morty's arm recognizes a soldier who killed his wife and children before torturing him, and proceeds to chase him away from the Blood Dome and kills him. With the arm wanting revenge against the soldier's boss, Morty is forced to come along. Meanwhile, Summer strikes up a romantic relationship with the new leader of the Death Stalkers, a guy with a bucket on his head named Hemorrhage .Wanting to hide their absence from Beth, Rick builds some Morty and Summer robots to both fool and cheer Beth up, but they only succeed in making her cry and leaving to call Jerry.Armothy's unfinished business.Morty and his arm, now dubbed \"Armothy,\" prepare to take revenge on the soldier's boss. Morty tries to convince Armothy to hold off on revenge so he can continue to vent his frustrations toward the divorce, but soon realizes that like Armothy, he needs to learn to move on. He starts to choke the man to death just as Rick arrives to retrieve him, admitting it would be too much trouble to find a different Morty and Summer to cheer up Beth. He then helps Morty finish off Armothy's murder victim.Well, this looks familiar.Rick and Morty meet up with Summer and Hemorrhage, offering up Isotope-322 and its powers as a peace-offering. Hemorrhage asks for his help in restoring society, which Rick agrees to, supposedly as a way to avoid dealing with his daughter's divorce. Three weeks later, the post-apocalypse has turned into something resembling modern-day suburbia, with Summer stuck in an unfulfilling marriage with Hemorrhage-- one resembling that of Jerry and Beth's.Summer's ready to leave.Frustrated, Summer agrees to return to her Earth with Rick and Morty, realizing Rick had planned the whole thing to teach her there was no running from her problems at home.

Morty is preparing himself for a school-advised therapy session in the bathroom when he hears Rick's voice. He follows the voice to the garage to find that Rick has turned himself into a pickle \"because he could.\" Beth and Summer appear and notice Rick's pickle status as well. Morty suspects that Rick did this to avoid going to the therapy session, noticing a dangling syringe rigged to inject Rick the moment the others leave. Rick denies the idea of getting out of going and claims the syringe to be irrelevant. In response, Beth removes the syringe, puts it in her purse, and leaves with her children.Now alone on the table, Rick starts making random sounds when a cat named Izzy appears. Rick tells the cat to back off stating that he has seen YouTube videos with cats attacking pickles because cats are afraid of snakes and think pickles are snakes. The cat knocks Rick over, pushing him outside of the garage and exposing Rick to the sun. Rick grudgingly states how dying in a pickle-form from the heat is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet. Fortunately, a timely rain shower saves him from that fate.Rick falls into the sewers.However, the resulting rush of water flushes Rick into the sewer drain forcing him to survive in the sewers. Rick creates a bit of pickle juice and lures a cockroach towards him. The cockroach is killed by Rick with a bite to the head and he removes part of the cockroach's head. Rick uses the brain of the cockroach to propel himself forward.At the counseling office, we learn that the therapy session has been advised by the school, for Summer huffing pottery enamel and Morty wetting his pants in class, both believed to be signs of protesting their parents' divorce. Mr. Goldenfold runs into them on his way out: he was in for eating poop and asks the others if they're in for the same. Beth, Summer, and Morty are greeted by Dr. Wong , the therapist, and their therapy session begins. Beth talks about how Rick couldn't attend and how he is a genius. Morty blurts out that Rick turned himself into a pickle. Dr. Wong uses this idea to start a discussion about why Rick turned himself into a pickle.\"OH YEAH!\" Rick's disgusting suit of rats parts.Rick is seen cutting a sewer grate using a makeshift exo-suit of decapitated roaches. As he is pondering his next move (to a sewer line), a sewer rat appears and tries to attack Rick. Rick uses an elaborate trap to decapitate the unwary rodent. Rick then taunts the other rats that arrived and puts the dead rat's head on top of another contraption, creating a rat version of an exo-suit. The sewer bars break open with the rats pouring in and Rick begins to kill every rat in sight with various small items, including screws and box-cutters.\"MOM!\" Beth continues to be both in denial and uncooperative.Inside the counseling office, Beth talks about how Rick is important. Summer replies back and says how Rick lied and turned himself into a pickle avoid the counseling session. Beth yells that Rick did not. Dr. Wong notices how the use of science is a common form of communication for the family and discusses this. Dr. Wong asks what could be inside the syringe with them replying it's a liquid that can change Rick back into a human. Beth disagrees and gets angry. She flips out and delivers f-bombs to both Dr. Wong and the siblings.Rick lands in the hero pose.Rick has just killed the largest and toughest rat and enters the sewer pipe using rockets. He lands out of a toilet and exultantly yells, \"PICKLE RIIICK!\" He leaves the men's bathroom and begins to search for an exit. He stumbles upon an elevator and moves some nearby objects to allow himself to parkour towards the elevator door button.A pickle shames them for not recycling.Rick is approached by some agents who speak Russian and begin shooting at Rick. Rick runs into a room and starts building weapons with office supplies. Rick taunts the Agency Director of the building while killing all the agents using traps bombs and a laser gun. The Agency Director uses a last resort method and calls upon a captured fighter named Jaguar to kill Rick.Back in therapy, Dr. Wong asks what is in the syringe with Beth replying that Dr. Wong should say it, while the siblings say it is anti-pickle serum. Dr. Wong talks about the serum with Beth cutting her off. Beth talks about how the session is supposed to be about the siblings being angry that she divorced Jerry. Morty starts to notice interesting features of the therapy room, particularly how there is a book displaying people eating feces. Dr. Wong says she isn't going to take sides and states that Beth admires Rick. Beth blatantly says it is better than making other peoples' problems, which Dr. Wong questions if that is the reason she looks up to him.\"OW\" Rick staples on a pickle slice to treat his wound.Rick and Jaguar begin fighting, leading to them both becoming wounded and treating their injuries, leading to them both talking about their motives. Rick proceeds to destroy all the cameras while fighting Jaguar. The Agency Director receives a call from Rick, saying \"Jaguar couldn't make it\", with Rick remarking that he'll hunt down the Agency Director. The Agency Director offers 100 million dollars in bonds but Rick demands it be given to Jaguar's daughter when she's set free. The Agency Director says she's dead, and Rick refuses to reason with the Agency Director, who then kills the two remaining guards and flees to the roof to get to a helicopter.The director looks up defeated.The helicopter flies away with Jaguar steering it and Rick, using a cigarette, creates an explosion that kills the Agency Director. Jaguar and Rick talk about their families, to which Jaguar ends by leaving. Jaguar is seen in a comic style flash ending.The family is seen using simple sentences to describe what they currently want: Summer and Morty admit that Summer's sniffing enamel and Morty's desk wetting have nothing to do with the divorce: one is just for getting high and the other is a mere accident.The wonderful Dr. Wong lays down some facts.Rick appears, badly injured, and joins them, asking Beth for the serum that will, indeed, turn him back into a human. Rick says he turned himself into a pickle because he doesn't respect therapy, and therefore, didn't want to go, claiming therapy is for boring people and he does not need it. Dr. Wong agrees that going to therapy, or rather taking the time to repair relationships with your family, is boring, but boring in the way that brushing your teeth or performing bathroom hygiene is not an adventure: there's no way to do it in a way that you can die, it is just about putting in work, and that perhaps some people would rather die than put in the work. Rick has no retort to this, and the session ends.Summer and Morty are ignored by some truly terrible parents.On the ride home, Rick apologizes to Beth for lying to her and Beth responds by injecting him with the syringe, finally turning him back into a human. Rick and Beth plan to go get a drink after dropping the siblings off while ignoring Summer and Morty asking if they'll ever go back to therapy.In the post-credits scene, Rick and Morty are tied up on a giant piano and are about to be killed by Concerto. Rick says how he is sorry for getting Morty into this situation and believes that they will definitely die. Unpredictably, Jaguar appears, kills Concerto, and leaves. Morty asks who that was and Rick replies, \"That Morty, is why you don't go to therapy\". Concerto is a clear reference to Liberace with a giant candelabra placed on a piano which was a characteristic attribute to his performances.Non-speaking charactersStarringView a full transcript of this episode here .

Rick outright refuses to answer an actual call to adventure , but ultimately relents because Morty brings up the fact that he gets to pick every tenth adventure.Supernova briefs all on Worldender.Rick and Morty are then seen sitting at a conference table getting briefed by Supernova on the threat of Worldender . Rick ends up heckling them at first then introduces every member of the Vindicators there except for Vance Maximus Renegade Star Soldier, who then shows up and seemingly charms everyone except Rick.It is then revealed that this is actually the third time the Vindicators had assembled and that they didn't invite Rick and Morty the second time due to a \"personality conflict\" with Rick and the rest of the Vindicators, which resulted in the deaths of three members of the Vindicators ( Lady Katana , Calypso , and Diablo Verde ).Rick on the conference room table.Rick then gets blackout drunk and we next see him pantsless and having gotten diarrhea all over the conference table the following morning. This mess is left to be cleaned up by Noob Noob instead of him going on the mission with the rest of the Vindicators. Then, Vance gives Morty a Vindicators vest as to symbolize he is a welcomed member of the Vindicators.Rick easily bypasses the machine guns.Inside Worldender's base, the Vindicators get through the traps, then into Worldender's main room. It is then revealed that Worldender is already dying/dead and Rick then tries to leave with Morty. But then, all of the Vindicators are trapped inside of the room, as set up by Rick when he was blackout drunk. It is revealed that \"Drunk Rick\" set up a Saw-like sequence where the Vindicators are forced to play games to survive or they all die. To make matters worse, Rick left his portal gun in the bathroom back on the Vindicators' ship while he was drunk meaning playing the games is the only way to escape.Vance, angered about getting SawedFollowing a nervous breakdown, Vance then attempts to escape, only to be shot, burned and bisected in the ventilation system in a gruesome death. Morty then solves the puzzle, matching the Vindicators with Rick's opinion of them: Unoriginal.Crocubot picks out Dorian 5.In the next room, Drunk Rick asks the Vindicators to locate a place they would never mention. Crocubot then goes to the hologram map of the universe to point out Dorian 5 . However, he is wrong and crushed to death. Dorian 5 is revealed to have been a planet destroyed (along with its populace) by the Vindicators to defeat Doom-nometron, a shapeshifter hiding on the planet during the Vindicators 2 mission. Rick stated that if they just brought him along, he could have created a machine to find Doom-nometron in a second. Morty then goes up to the map and locates Israel, the correct answer, as Morty knows that when Rick is blackout drunk, he rants about the United Nations and defense budgets, to which Rick defends isn't because he's anti-semitic.A domestic argument.In the next room they need to make 5 three-pointers in 5 minutes or else a neutrino bomb will blow up the planet. Morty goes to defuse the bomb, which is revealed to happen a lot more than Rick knew about, while the Vindicators work on scoring three-pointers. During this, Supernova, Million Ants , and Alan Rails discuss how Supernova and Alan were previously married, and how Supernova cheated on Alan with Million Ants. Alan and Million Ants then begin to fight, Supernova then suspends them in the air and Million Ants kills Alan. Rick makes a smart remark which is the final straw for Supernova who decides to arrest both Rick and Morty.Rick's final monologue.In the final room, Drunk Rick asks for something he believes the Vindicators have that he wants. It is assumed Drunk Rick is talking about Morty because the Vindicators are heroes to Morty-- and Rick isn't. So Morty steps on the platform and he is taken down into a ride in which it seems Drunk Rick is expressing his love for Morty as his grandson. However, it is revealed the ride was intended for Noob Noob, simply because he laughed at Rick's jokes about the Vindicators while Morty was caught up in hero worship.Supernova betrays Snuzzles Morty gets back out of the ride (with a look of disgust), and the platform they are on begins to rise. Supernova then goes to kill Rick and Morty for the deaths Drunk Rick caused, to which Million Ants tries to convince Supernova not to do it, only to be killed himself by Supernova.Before Supernova can do the same to Rick and Morty, the platform reaches a party with music star Logic singing a rap song about the Vindicators. Supernova gets away, and when Morty points it out, Rick dismissively says that 20 people try to kill him a week, and he ends up getting high with half of them, pointing out that Gearhead is there. The latter who takes Morty's Vindicators vest when Morty discards it. Beth and Summer are also at the party along with other previously seen characters.Logic hits the dab and it's kek, poggers and wholesome 100At that point Logic mentions Noob Noob in the rap song, to which Rick asks \"Who the fuck is Noob Noob?\", causing Morty to show another unpleasant look.In the post-credits scene, Gearhead is seen with the Vindicators vest trying to pick up some (possible) college girls, But then when an alien terrorist attack strikes, he goes down an alleyway to ditch the vest and run away, before he trips on a pile of gears and is dismantled.Non-speaking charactersStarringView a full transcript of this episode here .

As he prepares to go to sleep, however, Rick suddenly bursts into his apartment and drags him outside naked on the promise of an intergalactic adventure, to Jerry's confusion.On the ride through space, Jerry questions Rick's motive for inviting him, to which Rick explains he only did so at Morty's behest, worried that his father might turn to suicide. The reluctant duo arrives at an intergalactic resort on another world . When Rick and a supposed enemy ( Shnoopy Bloopers ) kill each other, then immediately come back to life, he explains to a shocked Jerry that the entire facility is surrounded by an immortality field, meaning that even if Jerry tried to kill himself while on their vacation, doing so would be impossible. Rick and Jerry have a drink at the bar and bond a little while alien watching.  Jerry is captured while using the resort's restroom and is brought before an actual enemy of Rick named Risotto Groupon , whose people were enslaved after Rick sold weapons to their enemies. With Jerry's help, he plans to assassinate Rick on a roller-coaster called the Whirly-Dirly, at the point where the ride travels outside the protective immortality field. When Jerry politely declines, Risotto allows him to leave unharmed.Jerry continues to drink with Rick, however, during the conversation Rick admits that he was essentially the whole reason Beth broke up with him. His new view of Rick now shattered, Jerry invites Rick to join him on the Whirly-Dirly. However while on the ride Rick apologizes for breaking up the marriage. A guilty Jerry changes his mind about killing Rick, but he can't get Rick off the ride once they're rolling. Assassins in a seat behind them take a shot; Jerry is killed but quickly revives. Rick notices the assassins and fights back. In the midst of the brawl, Jerry calls out to Rick and points to the area that dips outside of the field. Once the assassin has been dealt with Rick realizes something is amiss and asks Jerry how he knew about the kill point. He's interrupted when several more hit-men in a helicopter attempt to physically pull Rick outside the immortality field. Rick releases his lab coat, which detonates a bomb hidden inside, taking out the chopper and sending the roller coaster crashing into the surrounding jungle, deactivating the resort's immortality field in the process. A suspicious Rick again asks Jerry how he knew about the Whirly-Dirly, and a dying assassin reveals that they had made a deal. Rick angrily advances on a cowering Jerry, causing him to back into a massive alien snake.  Rick refuses to help as Jerry is slowly devoured. Jerry denounces Rick as a \"self-righteous piece of shit\" who stole his family. Infuriated, Rick volleys back by reminding Jerry that Beth was his daughter before she was his wife, and that her life was stolen when Jerry got her pregnant at prom, subsequently removing her from Rick's life. Further, Rick claims that Beth had options, but gave it all up because she felt sorry for Jerry. Risk accuses Jerry as acting like prey but really being a predator that feeds off other people's attention and pity. As Jerry is about to be digested, Rick finally kills the snake and saves him, only to then use him as bait to entice another alien creature. Just before Jerry is eaten, Rick shoots a tranquilizer into the creature and attaches wires to it, allowing him to control it and take them to an airfield with a shuttle that will get them close to the Milky Way.While traveling through a checkpoint for a spaceship heading off-world, Rick's cybernetic augmentations trip an alarm. A security guard declares him to be a terrorist and injects Rick with a synaptic dampener to block his violent tendencies, neutralizing him as a threat while leaving him free and unharmed. Rick is left functioning like a immature child. Jerry quickly takes advantage of the child-like Rick, belittling him the whole time. Risotto, unfortunately, catches up during this time and is ready to shoot Rick while he's too dumb to do anything. Risotto decides to let Jerry go, but not out of any compassion but because he feels that Jerry is a pathetic excuse of a man, and he would prefer not to waste the bullet. Jerry, determined to prove himself, attempts to fight off Risotto but fails miserably. Risotto changes his mind and decides to shoot Jerry, too. However, Jerry causes Risotto to shoot and damage an important piece of the ship's temporal shield just as the spaceship enters a wormhole. Space, time and thought all combine, causing Rick, Jerry and Risotto to merge and experience each other's souls and personalities for what feels like an eternity. When the trip through the wormhole ends they all feel changed by the experience and Risotto considers forgiving Rick. However, Rick, now free of the effects of the synaptic dampener, steals Risotto's gun using his cybernetic arm implants and shoots him dead anyway, telling Jerry that Risotto would soon change his mind again and try to kill them. Rick and Jerry return home and agree to leave out the parts of the adventure that make them look bad. Rick offers to let Jerry inside for a minute but Jerry declines, claiming that if the rest of his family saw him the state he was, they would feel sorry for him, and making people feel pity for him would no longer be his signature move. Rick bids Jerry farewell, only to promptly lock the doors and enable deadly anti-break in technology. Watching how happy his family is without him, Jerry sighs and walks home.Meanwhile, as Beth builds a small sculpture out of horse hooves, Summer asks Beth if she is hot. Beth simply says her looks are not something she should focus on, causing Summer to describe herself as hideous and retreat to the garage. It's then revealed that Ethan has broken up with her, claiming it was because they no longer had anything in common, and began dating another girl named Tricia Lange . Summer is convinced Ethan really chose Tricia over her because Tricia had larger breasts. She then tries to enlarge her breasts using Rick's Morphizer-XE but ends up becoming a disproportionate giant trapped inside the garage.Morty and Beth turn off the Morphizer-XE, and Summer resolves as a giant with disproportionate body parts.  Morty wants to call Rick, but Beth insists she can solve the problem without her father's help, to which Morty berates her for trying to be like Rick. Beth uses the Morphizer-XE on Summer, which brings her body parts back to normal proportions but leaves her a giant, larger than the house. Considering it progress, Beth rashly soldiers on and ends up turning Summer inside out.Morty insists that Beth call Rick, but instead she calls the machine's \"technical support.\" Unfortunately, it turns out the three (tiny) tech support workers actually live inside the machine, and they trick Beth into freeing them. Finally fed up with Beth's stubbornness, Morty snatches her phone and smashes it on the ground. He proceeds to admit that he tricked Rick into taking Jerry into space so he could get a little break from Rick's arrogance and irresponsibility but Beth ruined it by being just as bad as her father. Morty then tells Beth that sucking up to Rick won't help keep him around, but it would help drive everyone else away from her. Both of them then realize that Summer has disappeared. They quickly mount the Morphizer-XE into the back of the car and go off looking for Summer, with Morty shooting at random objects in an attempt to understand how the machine works. Beth finally defends herself from Morty's criticism by asking him what he would do if his daughter asked him if she was attractive. Morty asks Beth when Summer asked her that question, and she tells him that it was right before she super-sized herself. Upon hearing this, Morty deduces that Summer has gone to Camp Flabanabba where she and Ethan were supposed to go camping before he dumped her and took Tricia instead. As they approach the camp, Beth announces that she has a plan. An inside-out giant Summer appears to Ethan and Tricia, terrifying them, and is then startled to see Beth, also large and inside-out. The two reconcile and Tricia is so touched she runs home to make peace with her own mother. Ethan tries to follow her but Morty stops him so they can have a \"chat\". An grim Morty tells Ethan that he made Summer cry and ruined her self-esteem. Ethan tries to explain himself, but Morty shushes him and warns him to be careful because his \"s'more is burning.\"  The scene cuts away as Morty activates the Morphizer-XEIn a post-credits scene, a heavily-deformed Ethan is seen limping home, presumably morphed by Morty for hurting Summer and as a lesson in shallowness. The three tech support aliens spot him, but decide not to help due to their newfound freedom. Their relief turns to horror, however, when one of them is snatched and carried away in the talons an eagle, probably fated to be fed to baby birds.Non-speaking charactersUnknown voicesView a full transcript of this episode here .

The moment is interrupted by Rick, who asks Morty to go with him on what he promises to be a quick twenty-minute adventure for a crystal. Said adventure goes on for six days and, despite being heroes and Rick getting the crystal, both MortyandRick finally break down. Over-stressed from non-stop adventures, Rick finally decides it's time for a vacation.While relaxing at an alien spa, they decide to try out a machine that supposedly removes all the toxicity of its users. Upon use, Rick and Morty find themselves in a toxic wasteland full of disgusting creatures, at first believing the machine blew up the rest of the spa, only for Rick to discover that they aren't the real Rick and Morty: they areliterallythe toxicity of themselves, Toxic Rick as the rude, lying, alcoholic, god-complexed, genius asshole part of himself and Toxic Morty being the nervous, desperate, and self-loathing part of himself. While the real Rick and Morty leave the spa refreshed after their vacation\u2013Rick also has a normal skin color instead of hisgray-alcoholicskin color\u2013Toxic Rick begins plotting a way to get out.Morty, freed from all his insecurities, suddenly becomes confident in school, helping the self-esteem of almost all of the students and impressing Mr. Goldenfold by openly insulting him in class. Getting so popular at school, Jessica even notices him, to which he even works up the courage to ask Jessica out, which she happily accepts. However, Rick reveals to Morty he started receiving strange signals on his phone that he traced back to the spa and upon further investigation discovered what actually happened to their removed toxicity. Though Morty tells him to ignore it, Rick feels obligated to re-merge with his toxicity as he removed the part of himself that would not care, thus he does care that they accidentally created life.Morty's date with Jessica does not go well, as Jessica is thrown off by Morty's complete openness and seeming inability to stop talking. Morty is fine with it and convinces another girl named Stacy to come home with him. Upon arriving, he learns Rick purchased the machine from the spa and in cooperation with Toxic Rick and Toxic Morty rigged it so they could re-merge with their toxic selves. Morty refuses, claiming that Toxic Rick could be lying, so Rick tries to force him into the machine. However, just as the machine is activated, Morty says an agreed upon \"safe word\" (Sea Cucumber) and Stacy pulls the two out and takes their place, teleporting her into the tank and replacing her with Toxic Rick and Toxic Morty, who revel in having tricked their real selves until they realize they are all in the same room.Toxic Rick at first continues to try to get Rick into the toxic tank, but eventually resolves to make the whole world toxic instead, using a Moon Tower to transmit the toxicity around the planet. At first Rick refuses to stop them, saying it's not his place to decide which dimensions are saved or destroyed, but upon getting slapped by Morty, he realizes that the detox machine removes toxicity in a user based on that person's definition of toxicity. Toxic Rick manages to turn the world toxic, driving it to total depravity and violence, just as Rick and Morty arrive. Rick realized that his normal self considered his irrational attachments to people toxic, thus he knows Toxic Rick cares too much about Morty to allow him to die: with this knowledge, he shoots Toxic Morty with a nanobotic virus that will destroy him in twenty minutes, cutting that time in half with each progressive shot until an agonized Toxic Rick finally agrees to re-merge with him. Restored to his former self, Rick turns off the toxicity beam and restores the world, but Morty flies away with a jetpack to avoid having to re-merge with his toxic self. Rick is left shocked that he didn't expect this.Three weeks later, Morty has become aWolf of Wall Street-esque salesman in New York and living an altogether healthy lifestyle with his attractive girlfriend Jacqueline. While at his apartment he receives a call from Jessica begging him to come back, which he knows is part of Rick's plan to trace his location. However, he does not manage to hang up in time, and Rick and Jessica track him down. Using a group of drones to tie Morty down, Rick forcibly re-inserts the boy's toxicity, turning him back into his miserable self. While Rick and Jessica argue over who actually wanted regular Morty back, Morty amicably breaks up with Jacqueline. He offers her the apartment and the drones. However, Rick refuses to give up the latter because he loves their ability to form a Voltron-like combination.Mirroring the opening scene, Morty listens to Jessica talking about going out with Brad again, which she insists was not a date but her friends claim is proof they are back together. Just as Rick drags Morty into another adventure, Jessica stops him and lets him know she's glad to have him back.In the after-credits scene, a tour visits the Moon Tower and discovers the tank. Upon turning it on, Stacy is teleported back into the real world, screaming the safe word from earlier in the episode.Non-speaking charactersUnknown voicesView a full transcript of this episode here .

Our Rick and Morty refute the possibility of donation with hostility, pointing out that our Rick was the one to destroy it in the first place, and the pair leave.The scene then cuts to show a fully-fledged, well-developed Citadel, which has extended beyond being a mere government into the territory of being a (mostly) functional society consisting only of Ricks and Mortys. The Citadel makes quick work of recuperating from Rick's attempted destruction of it, with workers restructuring its foundation, commuters proceeding with their work and an election going on. Contention surrounds the fact that a Morty has decided to run a political campaign, with the news anchor Ricks sardonically and aggressively defaming him on the news, leading Campaign Manager Morty to suggest that Candidate Morty withdraw from the race. Despite this, Candidate Morty refuses.Meanwhile, a Morty Pride rally/protest is occurring on the streets. Here, a newly recruited Cop Rick , while standing outside the Cafe Sanchez , is surprised to discover that he has been paired with a jaded and critical Cop Morty , who possesses anti-Morty sentiments and tasers any Morty that gets close to his car, calling them slurs such as \"yellow-shirts\", (much to the surprise of Cop Rick). Despite being called out, Cop Morty digresses that no one cares about broken codes or corruption. The pair are called to attend to a robbery committed in \"Mortytown,\" a ghetto populated by Mortys who, for some reason or another, were deemed unsuitable for pairing with another Rick.While this occurs, a Morty school is in session, where Mortys are being educated on how to act for when they arebeenreassigned a new Rick. After the lesson, they are told they will graduate and be assigned a new Rick the following day. Hearing this, Lizard Morty , Glasses Morty and Left-Handed Morty (Left Hand Morty) are encouraged by Slick Morty to make the most of their small amount of time left together by going to the \"wishing portal\". The four eventually agree to embark on the journey together.As this takes place, a factory producing Simple Rick's wafers (wafers doused in the psychic resonance of Simple Rick and his memory of having spent time with a young Beth on her birthday), the Rick who would later become the Factory Terrorick ( Rick J-22 ) is passed by for a promotion in favor of Cool Rick (K-83).Meanwhile, Cop Rick and Cop Morty arrive in Mortytown to investigate the reported robbery, where Cop Rick learns more about the resident Mortys and what conditions they live with. The pair question the Morty Mart Manager Morty, who describes the robbers' appearances as four normal-looking Mortys. Whilst Cop Rick attempts to attain more information, Cop Morty uses his Morty-like nature to attempt to get some insider information from some vandalizing Mortys. After the vandalizing Mortys criticize him on his uniform and his relation to Rick, Cop Morty snaps, forcefully interrogating them and learning that a group called the \"Mortytown Locos\" were the ones who committed the crime. Cop Rick, shocked at Cop Morty's violation of codes, is ordered to get back into the car.During this, the Presidential Election Campaign has commenced, with the candidate Ricks all providing their own solutions to issues currently surrounding the Citadel. When the time comes for Politician Morty to offer his solution to the social divide between Ricks and Mortys, he is mocked by his rivals. However, he answers with clarity and delivers the conclusion that the great divide is a result of the death of the Citadel, and that the main solution is recognizing how there are many Ricks and Mortys who believe in the Citadel's prosperity and success, as opposed to those who don't. As the crowd responds with great applause, Campaign Manager Morty is amazed by Politician Morty's success, to which Politician Morty responds by firing him.As Politician Morty delivers his message, Rick J-22 manages to snap in rage, killing the Regional Manager Rick and forcing himself to retreat into the Simple Rick's Factory's Flavor Core with an unconscious Simple Rick, locking the room around him. As he is shown trapped in the room, SWAT Team Ricks begin to swarm the building, attempting to negotiate and rationalize with Rick J-22, but with no success.As Campaign Manager Morty watches the event unfold on the TV from a bar, the news coverage switches back towards the highly-likely victory for Politician Morty and his speeches. Displaying his negative feelings of the situation, Campaign Manager Morty is then confronted by Investigator Rick , who delivers some secret files and warns him that he should be fearful of what is to come.In Mortytown, the Mortytown Locos are also watching the same speeches, as Bootleg Portal Chemist Rick is attempting to create Bootleg Portal Fluid for inter-dimensional transport. At the same time, Cop Rick and Cop Morty break down the door, apprehending three of the Mortytown Locos. Bootleg Portal Chemist Rick attempts to escape through his own portal fluid, only to be killed due to issues of its bootleg-nature. Cop Rick then scouts around upstairs to find the fourth member of the Mortytown Locos, who plays with Rick's sympathy and stabs him in the shoulder. Rick quickly shoots the fourth member, and Cop Morty comforts Rick, saying that it is alright to put your faith in Mortys, but only the right ones. As Rick leaves to get medical treatment, Cop Morty then destroys the building.Meanwhile, Lizard Morty, Glasses Morty, Slick Morty, and Left-Handed Morty attempt to take some mega fruit, only to be chased off into a stream by an angry Mega Fruit Farmer Rick and his robot dog. As time turns to night, the group then gather around a campfire, where they converse over their wishes. Slick Morty, however, presents negative, dramatic opinion, causing Glasses Morty to comfort him by clarifying that he is more than just a dramatic person.Whilst this occurs, Politician Morty leavesHard RickCafe to a large crowd of Ricks and Mortys who are excited over his recent statements. Within this crowd, Politician Morty spots his former Campaign Manager Morty and asks about his job search. Campaign Manager Morty states his new job is to assassinate Politician Morty as he pulls a gun from his jacket and shoots Politician Morty, causing him to bleed and lose consciousness. Campaign Manager Morty is then swiftly tasered by a Secret Service Rick, causing him to be apprehended.Following their recent handling of the Mortytown Locos, Cop Morty takes Cop Rick to a club called The Creepy Morty, where he meets Big Morty , a drug-lord who presents Cop Rick and Cop Morty with money for their efforts. Cop Rick, having moral issues with this action, attempts to make an arrest of Big Morty, but causes a shootout in the club. During this shootout, Cop Morty tackles Big Morty to the ground, ready to kill. However, Cop Rick attempts to get Cop Morty to do the right thing, knowing he is capable of doing so. Cop Morty attempts to play with Rick's sympathy, only to end Big Morty by surprise, but Rick expected it this time and kills him before he can turn on him. Cop Rick leaves the club, where he surrenders to the other police officers over the death of the many Mortys in the club.Meanwhile, Rick J-22's negotiation for a working portal gun seemingly succeeds, causing the SWAT Team Ricks to deliver him a portal gun. Rick J-22 then awakens Simple Rick from his long unconscious state and sends him through the portal first, revealing that the dimension the portal gun was set to was the Blender Dimension and leads to Simple Rick's death. As he holds no leverage, the SWAT team finally cut a hole in the door to rush in, only to be stopped by Rick D. Sanchez III , who sympathizes with Rick J-22, letting him go free. However, as he is set free, a narrative voice appears again, revealing that Rick J-22's attempted escape is just a replaying memory which the company is feeding off of to create their new product.Lizard Morty, Glasses Morty, Slick Morty, and Left-Handed Morty all manage to get to the Wishing Portal, where they all throw something of value to them in return for a wish. Left-Handed Morty throws in his panini maker, wishing for a million sandwiches, while also acknowledging the irony of his wish. Lizard Morty throws in his surfer necklace, wishing for something better in return. Glasses Morty throws in a piece of technology, wishing for incest porn to be more mainstream. However, Slick Morty becomes sad and expresses his wish for life to change for Mortys, ultimately throwing himself into the portal. It is then later revealed that the portal is part of a garbage dump.Meanwhile, Campaign Manager Morty is thrown into an airlock chamber by Secret Service Ricks, revealing to him that his assassination attempt failed and that Politician Morty will become the President of the Citadel. Campaign Manager Morty attempts to warn them that Politician Morty is not who he seems, but the Secret Service Ricks disregard him, sending him out into the vacuum of space.Cop Rick is shown in a small interrogation room, ready to accept his punishment, when council members enter, telling him that he is free and none of his actions matter, due to the changes in department codes.Lizard Morty, Glasses Morty, and Left-Handed Morty return to Morty School, only to find Teacher Rick to be locking the doors, revealing that no Ricks will be coming for the graduation and that he is fired, due to changes in the curriculum. The trio believes that Slick Morty's wish came true, where now a new, different life is available for Mortys.Rick D. Sanchez III enters a room with the Shadow Council of Ricks and the new President Morty. One member of the Council, Garment District Rick, then raises his opinion, stating that it doesn't matter who sits in the president's chair as the Council has, and always will, have control over the Citadel. President Morty, who has his back to them, responds to this by holding up his mirror and having the Ricks raise their hand if they agree with that statement before calling his guards to assassinate those who agreed. President Morty then asks the surviving Ricks, who are all now terrified, if they will obey and they agree.A montage shows new banners being deployed, Cop Rick going back to work, the trio of Lizard Morty, Glasses Morty, and Left-Handed Morty clad in new uniforms and harvesting mega fruits, and the corpses of the council members being dragged into airlock chambers, while President Morty ponders about making a \"cold, calculated speech with sinister overtones\" about the changes in politics, about order, brotherhood, and power, only to declare that, now that he is elected, the time for speeches is over and he can finally act.The dead council members are expelled into space, where they join the floating bodies of many Ricks and Mortys, including Cop Morty, Big Morty, Investigator Rick, and lastly Campaign Manager Morty, shown next to the secret documents which reveal the newly-elected \"President Morty\" is none other than Evil Morty .In the post-credit scene, Rick C-137 and his Morty return from their Atlantis adventure, where they boast and recollect about their sexual interactions with the mermaids. Morty asks Rick if he is concerned at all about the Citadel's return, to which he confidently responds that such a place \"will never have any bearing over [their] lives ever again\".Non-speaking charactersView a transcript of the episode here .

Escher's painting \"Relativity\" in which there are stairs all over the place and the rules. Morty is seen holding a turtle-like creature named the \"Truth Tortoise.\" Morty looks at the Truth Tortoise, despite Rick's warnings, and causes Morty to drop the creature in a void. The place collapses, but not before the duo escapes.Both of them arrive to the Smith residence. Rick wants both of them to watch Interdimensional Cable, but Morty complains about the looping memory in his head and asks Rick to erase the memory off his mind. So Rick leads Morty to a secret chamber underneath the garage, which contains various tubes that archives memories Morty wanted Rick to remove. Rick calls them \"Morty's Mind Blowers\" hence the title, then faces the audience telling them that they will be doing this instead of watching Interdimensional Cable.Morty asks Rick how long he ever wanted to remove certain memories, and Rick just replies that he wanted to \"ever since your (Morty) mind was blown.\" Rick grabs a blue tube and nicknames it \"Moon-spiracy\" just before Rick activates the helmet and places the tube on the hole of the helmet.The memory starts off with Morty and a telescope just outside their front lawn. Morty at first admires the American flag planted on the lunar surface before he notices a strange figure standing in a mid-stride walking pose. He then goes and tells his family, but nobody, including Rick, believes him; they suggest that it was merely a smudge on the lens. He then finds out that Mr. Lunas is, in fact, a real person, as he comes to Morty's high school to work as a guidance counselor. Later on, Morty snaps pictures of Lunas, planting an American flag in his yard, and tells Principal Vagina that he thinks Lunas is \"up to something\" and \"lives on the moon.\" Vagina takes this as a metaphor for pedophilia and goes outside to the parking lot to confront Lunas, ending in Lunas getting punched in the face. As a result of this accusation, Lunas goes home and commits suicide, which Morty finds out about from the ambulances outside of Lunas' home. Morty later eavesdrops on Lunas' funeral, where it is learned that Lunas served in the Marine Corps, and that \"from a certain angle, some people would say he looked like a smudge.\" Morty then runs home and sees that there is, in fact, a smudge on his telescope lens, realizing that he inadvertently drove Lunas to kill himself.Morty ended up inserting memories on his own. He started to remember Beth choosing Summer's life over his, Beth, Summer, and Rick insulting Morty as Voltematron forces himself back into Morty's mouth, Rick killing an animal that helped them find water and having him and Morty enter its guts after confusing Venzenulon 7 with Venzenulon 9, Rick tricking NASA employees into rescuing them so they could replace him and Morty in a menagerie, Morty getting chased by a hoard of squirrels after learning they controlled the world forcing him and Rick to move to a new reality again, Rick sending lambs to the Cosmic Slaughter, Morty having his hand chopped off, Rick hunting Morty as a ghost, Morty's head being attached to Snowball's body, Rick juggling Morty's body parts, Morty being eaten and pooped out by an alien, Mr. Poopybutthole proposing to Morty, etc. Rick also happened to have erased memories from Morty that involved Rick himself getting embarrassed just to secure his own pride.After realizing that Rick also took away memories without Morty asking or even wanting him to, Morty gets enraged and attacks Rick, pinning him to the floor. Rick manages to use the mind eraser on Morty, but Morty turns the tables and points the device at Rick while it's still being used. This causes them to not remember each other. Trying to find out who they are, Morty uses the helmet and goes through many more traumatic memories until he snaps and decides to kill himself over it, while Rick joins in as part of the suicide pact.Summer enters as Rick and Morty have guns to their own heads. When Rick doesn't remember her, Summer quickly realizes the situation. She reveals that Rick had a contingency plan should this happen (and has used it several times before) and tranquilizes them, restores both of their memories and drags them to the living room. Rick and Morty wake up on the couch. They believe that they slept through an entire \"Interdimensional Cable\" episode as Rick questions how that even happened. The two then hurl verbal abuse at Summer and decide to head off on another adventure. Summer moans that this is the reason the two are \"constantly fighting and behind schedule\".In the post-credits scene, Jerry shows up in Rick's garage and discovers a box containing \" Jerry's Mind Blowers \" where, in a twisted homage toE.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, he discovers he accidentally left an alien to die in his car.Non-speaking charactersUnknown voicesThe truth tortoise.This episode suggests that Rick and Morty might have left Dimension C-131 that they can change dimension only a couple of times.

Rick then gets offended and reveals her \"imaginary world\" was actually one of his inventions created for her to play in. Beth realizes this means that Tommy might actually still be trapped in there and enters the realm with Rick. As Beth argues with Rick about spending her childhood in the \"glorified chicken coop\" instead of by his side, Rick is captured and nearly fed to the offspring of a giant bird-like creature, losing an arm in the process.After fighting off the bird and her babies using a new mechanical arm, Rick and Beth discover that the lifeforms have been created and corrupted using human DNA, indicating that Tommy is indeed still trapped in the dimension. Beth theorizes that Tommy committed intercourse with the Froopyland creatures in order to produce children of which he would consume in order to sustain himself and Rick adds that it is also likely that the less appetizing of them (for Tommy) would worship Tommy as their god. Rick's assumption is revealed to be true once the two are captured by a group of Tommy's children (human/Froopyland creature hybrids). Upon being captured and brought before Tommy, they learn (to no surprise) that he has become the dimension's de facto leader and commits incest with his children as well as cannibalism to survive, just as Rick and Beth figured out. However, Tommy reveals in a play thatBethwas the one responsible for trapping him in Froopyland, out of jealousy for his own father. Following the play, Tommy decides to give a \"demonstration\" on how he nourishes himself in Froopyland, to which Rick responds out of disgust by quickly leaving with Beth in tow.When Beth asserts that their \"adventure\" is not over, Rick tries to justify keeping Beth in Froopyland for most of her childhood by saying that she was \"a scary fucking kid\" that frequently asked him to make borderline, if not blatantly, psychotic toys and devices to use on the neighbors' kids. Beth tries to blame Rick for her actions, claiming that she only did it so Rick would spend more time with her, and she resolves to save Tommy from the dimension. But when she refuses to apologize for trapping him in Froopyland, Tommy refuses to leave and sics his children on her, causing her to go into a defense-induced killing frenzy, during which she presumably kills Tommy. Beth returns with his severed finger and Rick and Beth create an adult clone of Tommy in order to save his father from lethal injection. Pondering her life and finally confronting Rick, Beth discovers she has two options: leave the family to travel the cosmos while Rick replaces her with a clone, or stay with the family and be content with the life she has chosen. Her decision is left ambiguous.Meanwhile, Jerry begins dating Keara , an alien highly invested in hunting, much to Morty and Summer 's dismay. After becoming exhausted on one of their hunting sessions with Keara, Jerry admits to Summer and Morty that he wants to break up with Keara to which the two encourage him to confront her about it. The following day, Summer and Morty find themselves on the run from Keara after Jerry warns them that she wants to kill them. It is then revealed that this is because Jerry claimed that they were trying to end his and Keara's relationship. While trying to kill Morty and Summer, she breaks up with Jerry once he reveals that he also wanted to end their relationship. Afterward, it is revealed she is using him as a rebound to get over a previous ex, much like Jerry was with her.Post-credit scene: Jerry's answering machine plays messages that detail Keara warning Jerry that her new boyfriend is angry with him, the boyfriend calling and saying he's coming after Jerry, Rick assuring Jerry he killed the alien hunter and then saying he had sex with Keara.

Upon arriving at the White House (via Portal Gun), they agree to do so, though the President once again denies Morty's request for a selfie. After shooting and scaring off the (small) alien creature, Rick and Morty quickly get bored and return home to play more Minecraft . Unfortunately, the Secret Service has been watching them the entire time, and inform the President that Rick and Morty \"just blew off America.\"Seeing Rick and Morty at their home via satellite (complete with thermal imaging), an unhappy President calls them on their progress regarding the monster. Rick and Morty lie about their progress, but the President calls their bluff, and an argument erupts over the two's constant law breaking despite saving the world several times. The two cut ties with the President, and in private, he is visibly heartbroken.Meanwhile, Summer and Beth are shopping, with Beth giving her daughter very good advice on her choices. Summer reacts positively to her mother's new behavior, saying that she couldn't stand her old negative behavior before, as if she's an almost different person. Beth, however, reacts badly to it.When a miniature civilization is discovered in the Amazon rainforest, Rick and Morty travel to Brazil to investigate. At the same time, however, the U.S. Government arrives claiming jurisdiction. When Rick and Morty protest, the President has them arrested and shrinks down to negotiate with the civilization. Once he leaves, Rick and Morty break free of their restraints (made of the fake element \"Sanchezium\") and quickly escape from being surrounded by pirates, one of the few things Rick fears.Back at home, Beth continues to question her status as a clone, and calls Rick to confirm it. Though Rick assures her she is not a clone and would kill her clone self should it become aware of the fact, it only fuels her growing paranoia.Upon arriving at the Mega Gargantuan civilization, the President is disappointed to learn that Rick and Morty have already negotiated a peace treaty with their Presidentress. Once back to his normal size, the President declares war on Rick and Morty, growing even more upset after learning that they had also negotiated a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Palestine and gave him all the credit.Following the ensuing press conference, The President asks for Rick and Morty's whereabouts, only to discover they have both been patiently waiting inside the Oval Office. Having fulfilled the President's agenda for him, Rick promises to leave for good on the condition that Morty gets a selfie with the President, regardless of his grandson's lack of interest. When the President continues to refuse the request, Rick indirectly kills most of the Secret Service agents surrounding him, culminating in a lengthy battle with the President throughout the White House.Meanwhile, a desperate Beth turns to Jerry for help with her identity crisis. Jerry does his best by explaining and recreating the moment he first confessed his love for her in vivid detail. Coming to terms with herself and realizing his unconditional love, Beth rekindles her relationship with Jerry.Back at the White House, Rick finally forces the President to agree to do a selfie with Morty, only to find that his grandson has disappeared.

Soon enough, Rick locates the Smith family hideout, arriving through the President's portal. After Beth tries to reason with her father, Rick assures her that she is still herself which is his daughter and only arrived to kill Jerry, but ultimately decides not to, begrudgingly accepting him back into the family, sacrificing his own position as the family patriarch. Having done enough damage in the current dimension, Rick seemingly plans to leave it for another and tries to get Morty to come, but he refuses, choosing to stay with his family. Rick grows annoyed with his grandson's choice, as there are countless dimensions he can go to where the same events have already happened. However, Summer's new-found ability to fart on cue like Rick convinces him to stay.Afterwards, Rick (disguised as another dimension's version of himself called \"Fly Fishing Rick\") fixes his friendship with the President and returns home for dinner.

Beth and Jerry, unhappy, tell Rick to respect Morty. After reluctantly apologizing and nicely asking, the two go to Forbodulon Prime to find death crystals, small crystals that allow the holder to see the possible deaths they can encounter. Morty unknowingly steals one from Rick as he uses it to get his best future outcome. In this outcome, he is lying in bed as an old man as Jessica tells him she loves him.After fighting over the wheel, the ship crashes as Rick is flung into a spiked rock, killing him.

Morty disobeys, taking the ship.Fascist Morty shoots Fascist Rick.Meanwhile, Rick revives in another reality, due to Operation Phoenix , carrying out in a in a loop of realities. Much to his annoyance however, each reality that he reincarnates in is a reality where extreme fascism rules, and is forced to commit a repeat series of mass murder and suicide to reach a reality peaceful and politically stable enough for that reality's Rick and Morty to help him return to his own.Morty's infamous case comes to a close.Back in the main reality, Morty, being guided by the death crystal he stole, experiences trouble back home and becomes determined to have the reality where he dies next to Jessica to come true. He travels back home and, guided by the crystal, is lead on to do rather bizarre and outlandish things to ensure the outcome. Upon mistakenly riling an extremely violent local school bully, the situation escalates, pushing Morty to access Rick's arsenal, grab several high powered weapons and takes all of Rick's Mr. Meeseeks boxes (except for the \"shitty Kirkland brand Meeseeks boxes\"). He then deals with the bullies, and soon goes on a bloody rampage as the police and even the army become involved, but due to the crystal, he is able to avoid a quite lengthy and certain death sentence, resulting in the presiding judge to declare him innocent and later commit suicide due to Morty's words. Then, on live television, he hesitently let out a cognitohazardous howl, the frequencies of which swayed the undivided focus of anyone listening and convinced them to completely forgive his actions and rendered the entire massacre canonically irrelevant.TetsumortyMeanwhile, Rick eventually finds a peaceful reality where he is a wasp and Wasp Rick agrees to help him get back to his original reality. Once they arrive, Rick discovers Morty's theft of his gadgets, dismayed that the only Mr. Meeseeks boxes left behind were cheap, knock-off ones. After they confront the Hologram Rick that appears in the garage, the three Ricks go off in search of Morty.Hologram Rick becoming too big for his britches.They discover him out in a desert becoming a monstrous tree-like cyborg abomination and defeat him, only for Hologram Rick to become assimilated and attempt to destroy the regular Rick, Wasp Rick, and Morty. As Rick and Morty are struck and fall to the ground, Wasp Rick stings the Rick-tree abomination in the eye, causing its head to start swelling up and explodes, releasing numerous mini Wasp Ricks into the air.After things return to normal, Morty apologizes to his grandfather for not listening to him, as Rick takes it in stride. Beth and Jerry appear and attempt to persuade Rick to stop his adventures, because of what happened only for Morty to say he is the one at fault and explain that Rick wasn't even around when the events occurred. Hearing this, Beth states the important thing is that he is okay. Jerry tried to threaten Rick who claims that by touching him, Jerry now has AIDS, causing Jerry to run off in a panic with Beth following behind.

On Glootie's forehead is a tattoo that says \"DO NOT DEVELOP MY APP\". While Glootie persistently asks the family if anyone would like to develop his app, Rick dismisses him and when Jerry asks why the message was tattooed on Glootie's head, Rick specifically says it's so Jerry doesn't do develop Glootie's app. Done with breakfast, Rick alludes to going to the bathroom in a roundabout way. As soon as he steps out of the room, however, Summer explains that Rick is a \"shy pooper\" and elaborates on how shy he is in detail, even telling the rest of the family he has a special pooping place. Jerry smugly states that he's not a shy pooper like Rick, to sarcastic congratulations.After he finishes with his own toilet business, Jerry loiters by Glootie who is photocopying something. They get into a short conversation about developing Glootie's app without really explaining what it is. Jerry immediately jumps to agree to develop Glootie's app with minimal persuasion.Rick's secret pooping place.On a gorgeous lush planet with beautiful exotic plant life and landscape, Rick lands his ship on a sparkling beach. He wades through tall grass while inhaling the air and goes through a forest with thick tall trees before reaching a toilet seat on a short platform. While enjoying the breathtaking view with its glittering aurora borealis-like light display in the night sky, running glistening stream nearby, gentle breeze, and distant calls of the wild, Rick takes a poop in isolation.After he's done he washes his hands under a small, natural waterfall, he spots a suspiciously broken tree branch a few feet away. Rick pulls out an instrument to analyze which of the inhabitants of the planet could've broken it, but the results are unknown. Furious, Rick lets out a whaling cry. One of the alien animals approaches in response, and Rick turns one of its antlers, revealing it to be a robot of some kind. The creature trots to a tree and connects with it, which opens an elevator in the tree. Deep underground, Rick has a high tech setup. Using a computer, he analyzes the matter that didn't come from him and finds out it's from a specific sandwich an unidentifiable intruder digested earlier.Back at the Smith Residence, Jerry and Glootie pop champagne celebrating the launch of their app just as Morty walks past the doorway. Morty stops and enters, immediately realizing what Jerry did. Morty incredulously asks why Jerry thinks Rick told them not to develop Glootie's app. When Jerry dismissively says it's because Rick is a \"disrupt-o-phobe\". Morty grabs him by the collar and tells him it's too keep something horrible from happening that Rick was too lazy to explain. Glootie gladly chimes in to inform them that they've got their first users of the app.At the mall, Summer happily opens the new app \"Lovefinderrz\" on her phone, which just matched her toDanny Publits, a 25-year-old who works at Jersey Mike's and watches 25 Phish shows a year. Beth, who was eating lunch with her, disapproves, not least of which because of Danny's age. When Danny runs over to them in a mess, he blatantly ignores Beth, and he and Summer run off together. Meanwhile, many other people also get notifications on their phones from Lovefinderrz and start running off to their new romantic matches too. Beth, scandalized, calls Jerry to let him know what's going on, disparaging Lovefinderrz's poorly-given name, and informing him she'll be late.Morty dismays over Jerry's failure to follow basic commands given by Rick.Embarrassed, Jerry tells Glootie to shut the app down. But Glootie says he can't; he's just an intern. Dismayed and frustrated, Morty destroys their computer set-up with a tennis racket. Unfortunately, that's not how apps work, as stated by Glootie, and destroying their computer won't immediately affect the app at all. Morty shakes Glootie and tells him to get it off the server then. Glootie tells Morty and Jerry the servers are on his mothership. After a little more shaking and an escape attempt using an \"Ominous Beeping App,\" he is coerced into taking them aboard.At the Best Frog Food Place in Gorgon Quadrant, Rick bursts in on a fly-creature mob boss named Vermigurber surrounded by his frog lackeys. Rick wants to know about the sandwich, which is first misconstrued to be double-talk for drugs or guns. After Rick threatens the lives of Vermigurber's 470,000 of 800,000 kids and learning that Rick really was there about a literal sandwich, he tells Rick what he wants to know: who ordered the sandwich. Vermigurber doesn't know, but he does tell Rick that the delivery drone who delivered it ran off to fight in the robot wars.It's worth it to Rick.Back with Summer, who just rented motel keys, and Danny, they get interrupted by Beth. When Beth grabs onto Summer's arm to stop her, Summer yells \"assault!,\" to which Beth retaliates with \"statutory rape!\" An exhausted-looking motel guest joins the commotion from his window on a higher floor to tell them the people at the motel have their own problems and can't afford to get mixed up in theirs, so they must deal with theirs on their own. Summer tells Beth she can't stop Summer from getting a hotel room, so Beth stubbornly says she'll get the room next to theirs and listen to them with a glass against the wall.Summer and Beth cry crimes.On the mothership, Morty and Jerry tell the first person in the teleporter room to take the app down. After Glootie confirms he's their hostage and that none of them have a weapon, the second secretary tells them he's an intern so he can't do anything about the app either. Morty tells him to take them to someone who can do something or he will punch him. He agrees after a beat and they are all escorted to meet the leader of the Monogatrons , Glootie's species.The leader tells them that while human race had still been toying with fire, theirs had tamed the power of functioning, committed relationships. Again, Jerry and Morty demand that the app is taken down or else they'll punch him. The leader looks around wondering if there was someone with a gun or other weaon, and Glootie reports it's on its way. Jerry asks what the evil plan is, to which the leader returns with his question of if an evil plan is necessary. The Smiths awkwardly mumble before a gun is finally brought in and it turns out that there really was an evil plan involved. The app was a lure to people with the promise of \"love.\" As a primitive pre-app species, humans don't realize love is abundant, but not as abundant as water, which is what the leader of the Monogatrons wants from the humans and their planet, and he's using humans' love seeking flaw as a distraction.Jerry and Morty vs. the interns.As the leader is explaining his plan, on Earth, Summer leaves Danny in the middle of the night when the app matches her with someone new and various others around do the same, dumping their previous lovers easily for their new \"soulmate\" their app matches them with.After explaining the plan, the leader's wife comes in to make date plans. While she and her husband are talking to each other like how to partners in a healthy relationship would, Jerry and Morty fight off the interns and try to escape.Rick finds thedeliverydeliverance drone.In the middle of the robot wars battlefield at the Midland Quasar , Rick impersonates a Lieutenant Commander by wearing a metal funnel with a QR code on its side as a hat. Just as Rick finds the delivery drone to ask about who he delivered an avian protein club sandwich with no lettuce to, it gets shot in the head. Rick rushes to grab three of the four pieces of the drone's memory archive chip after it is killed in battle, killing a few lizard soldiers standing in his in the process. Upon encountering the fourth quarter, one of the lizard people mockingly swallows the last piece in front of Rick. Out of annoyance, Rick single-handedly upsets the war and the Robolution overturns the lizards.Conference room three.While the news is being delivered, in a quiet alien office, Rick delivers a sealed contamination box to a solemn, soft-spoken office worker named Tony . Rick asks where he wants to die, to which Tony calmly asks Susan if conference room three was available. In the office, Tony asks if he could look at a photo of his wife while Rick kills him. Tony soberly and gently explains that his wife is dead, that he's a shy pooper, and that was the reason why he used Rick's nice toilet. Rick gives him a look, before portaling to another dimension where Tony's wife lived, bringing that version of Tony over to explain he used a really awesome toilet that day too. Disgusted, Rick shoves the other Tony back to his dimension and tells Tony not to use his dead wife as an excuse for being a toilet thief. When Rick makes to leave, Tony wonders if Rick's not going to kill him. Petulantly, Rick shouts, \"Don't tell me what to do!\" before setting a dung bomb on the conference table that poops up a middle finger after stinking the whole room up.Robot Rick about to sit on Tony.Back in his high tech bunker, Rick is vibing when he gets an alert that Tony has returned to poop on the toiler. Rick disbelievingly gets into a giant robot version of himself to confront Tony. The two get into an argument, with Tony fearlessly telling the giant Rick that pooping is a bid for control; a way to protect that one thing from a universe that takes whatever it wants. Rick stubbornly turns around, pulls his pants down, and sits on Tony in response.Tony opens his eyes to cloudy toilet heaven and is greeted by his wife. Both God and his wife encourage him to poop with them, but Tony grows more dissatisfied and sad the more they insist. It turns out Tony is actually hooked up to a giant artificial sac filled with a red liquid. Perhaps subconsciously Tony is aware it's not actually heaven, so his body twists itself around to choke himself with the breathing tubes. Before he can die, Rick comes to cut him out.Tony bewildered.Indignant, Rick explains the chemical is called Globaflyn , which connects the whatever-you-want section of the brain to the whatever-you-have section. Tony looks around at all the various people trapped in sacs which is kind of prison Rick built where they could live their wildest dreams while leaving Rick out of them. Tony hits the nail on the head with the realization that they're people Rick refuses to kill and refuses to let into his life. Pettily, Rick opens a portal and tells him it's Tony's last chance since he rejected the heaven Rick had offered. Amused, Tony tells Rick he'll be seeing him, offering friendship even as Rick, ill-tempered, pretends otherwise.Morty and Jerry discovered.In a ventilation shaft, Morty and Jerry come up with a plan to destroy the mothership and escape. Exasperated and fed-up, Morty wearily agrees. Jerry insists on a high-five despite Morty's ill humor and pointed comments about how they were in that mess because of Jerry but finally gives in. Unfortunately, the grate under them collapses and the two land in the middle of an army of soldiers.Back with the toilet, Rick rigs and connects it to a complicated-looking and foreboding looking system.Summer's 4th \"soulmate.\"On Earth, havoc continues to reign with the constantly hooking-up and un-hooking-up couples. Summer paraglides into a church to interrupt the wedding between her latest beau, Jeff. Just as Jeff asks the priest to marry them instead of with the bride, a man on a motorcycle bursts in to take Jeff away. The two ride away just as another man riding a horse burst through a window for the bride. Another wall collapse as a construction worker rides a crane to pick up the priest. Then a woman in a hot air balloon crashed through the ceiling for Summer. Beth, determinedly following Summer, crashes her paraglider into a barnyard. The farmer inside shouts at her in shock asking what she's doing. Beth shortly replies she's parenting.Locked up, Morty and Jerry are freed by Glootie after Jerry manages to bond with him. Glootie implies he'll take down the dating app before making a whimsical exit.Rick enters Tony's office building and asks the tearful receptionist if he's there since he brought him some Vegan Fiber Chili and a box of sugar-free chocolate, and to tell him the toilet's all his. She sadly informs Rick that Tony died after quitting his job, living life to the fullest before crashing into a tree space-skiing down Mount Space Everest.Everyone starts deleting Lovefinderrz.Summer, who was on a plane with the last woman gets another ping on her phone to let her know she has a new soulmate and leaves to meet him. After greeting him, she gets into another fight with Beth who is determined to mother her. The two get into a dramatic physical fight on the airport apron. When Summer's phone pings yet again, she desperately picks it up after Beth had knocked it away momentarily. This time however the app is covered with Ad wall. Already tired of it, Summer deletes the app and numerous others with the app do the same. Listlessly, Summer and Beth head home.The Monogatron leader gets huffy about losing Earth and when his wife tries to console him they end up bickering about the importance of water over their relationship.Beth matched with Ted Danson.Back home, Jerry and Beth talk about Beth using the app, but Beth reassures him she didn't. The two hug and Beth hides the fact that she was matched up with Ted Danson before deleting the app.At Tony's funeral, Rick gives Tony's dad $8 billion in his local currency, a kit to clone a new son even though it wouldn't have the same brain as Tony, and tries to comfort the dad by explaining in that one of the infinite universes Rick explored there's a version of Tony that was completely evil because of how fulfilled he was. Sympathetically, the dad puts a hand on Rick's chest, intuitively saying it was hard losing a friend. Rick abruptly curses him and denies he was Rick's friend.Rick crowned the King of Shit.Back at the toilet, Rick pees over the side of the cliff instead of using the toilet. He drunkenly stumbles over to it before sitting down. When the two intimidating giant-gun like mechanisms rise out of the ground point at him, they turn out to be speakers, repeatedly mocking in Rick's voice as numerous holograms of him appear cheering and applauding. As Rick sits on the toilet and the main hologram continues to mock him, a crown that was in the toilet tank is placed on Rick's head and it starts to rain. Rick's situation has a similar feeling that of what happens at the end of \"Auto Erotic Assimilation\" in season 2 episode 3.\"...The saddest piece of garbage in the entire cosmos\".In the after-credits, Jerry takes a lick of Globaflyn from the fridge and sees himself as a water-cooler replacement man for \"Mountain Sweat\" and getting thanked and appreciated by a woman.

Rick reveals that the skull was already in Morty's bag, and divulges that he had built a robot in his garage. The robot, named Heistotron, is tasked by Rick to calculate Miles's heist plan and add a double cross with a switcheroo. The bot gives him the three members as most likely to double-cross him, and upon being snipped by Miles to his team, hypnotizes all of them to give Rick and Morty the crystal. In addition, while the bot also puts all the attendees in a state of hypnosis, Rick and Morty wait at the bar where the latter is writing a heist script.

Accepting it, Jerry asks the cat several times why it can talk but the cat tells Jerry not to worry about it; to go with the flow and not ask too many questions. And that they go to Florida.After Morty flies around with Balthromaw for a while, they land for a break. While Morty puts on the pretense that what they have is a partnership of equality, Balthromaw only wants to laze around, which Morty roundaboutly shuts down.Rick and Balthromaw get high.The dragon retreats to a newly dug cavern underneath the Smith family yard; while Rick is watching TV with Summer , they both notice and poke fun at how dejected Morty is with a dragon.

While laying low, they and Balthromaw encounter several other outcast/slut dragons includingDebrah, Michael and the Shadow Jacker.

Morty passes on Beth\u2019s concerns that Jerry will kill himself in the light-hanging process. Jerry says he can hang lights safely; Rick responds by accusing Jerry of lying. Jerry promptly falls off the roof, but before he hits the ground, Rick zaps him with a ray that makes Jerry\u2019s body lighter than air. He then zaps Jerry\u2019s shoes with a ray that makes them heavier than air, rendering Jerry \u201cneutrally buoyant\u201d. As Rick and Morty climb into the spaceship, Jerry celebrates his buoyancy, which allows him to jump high up in the air and then slowly sink back down. Remembering a warning that the ray will eventually wear off, Jerry sets a timer to keep track of how long he will be neutrally buoyant.In space, Rick and Morty are arguing about piss and centipedes when (somehow) the spaceship hits \u201ca sharp thing in space\u201d and gets a flat tire.

Morty kills the snake by breaking its astronaut suit with a hubcap, but it is clear he has been seriously injured.Snake racism.

Rick flies to the snake\u2019s home planet, scans it, and synthesizes an anti-venom serum, which promptly cures Morty. The scan also reveals that the snakes on the planet have formed an advanced patchwork of industrial societies\u2014 there are 19 billion snakes divided into 10,000 nations, all on the brink of global war because of race.

He goes to a pet store & buys a snake roughly the size of the space snake to take her place, whom he names Slippy. Morty proceeds to draw markings on Slippy similar to the ones the space snake had and then force Slippy into the space snake\u2019s astronaut suit, being bitten multiple times in the process.Slippy picked up and on the snake news.Morty then flies Slippy to the snake planet and throws her out the window. A parachute opens on the spacesuit, gently carrying Slippy down to the surface. Military officials from one of the nations on the snake planet detect Slippy and intercept her.We then see a montage of Snake scientists, academics, politicians, and military officials attempting to interact with Slippy. The nation\u2019s president appears at a press conference with Slippy, who hisses at reporters in a language they don\u2019t understand. Snake academics record these hisses and attempt to decipher them. One snake professor finally manages to translate them. The military then recruits the professor to talk with Slippy, who is being held in a room at the Snake Pentagon.The two snakes fuck.The professor talks with Slippy, first through an intercom and later by entering the room and speaking with her directly. Though Slippy seems suspicious at first, she eventually grows to trust the professor. She wraps herself around the professor in an aggressive display of affection. Though surprised, the professor quickly reciprocates, and the two make love while being monitored by other snake military officials.Back on earth, Rick, Morty and Summer are playing Downbeat when Beth enters the room and asks about Jerry. Morty, much to Rick\u2019s chagrin, reveals that Rick made Jerry lighter than air. Beth expresses concern that Jerry will fall out of the sky to his death; Rick responds that that could only happen if Jerry messes up wearing shoes. Quickly realizing that that is in fact quite possible, Rick and Beth rush to find & save Jerry.Horrific Jerry clone headJerry is revealed to be flying through the sky while attempting to return to the ground. He has tied the legs of his pants together and is holding the torso area open so the pants will fill with rainwater. Beth calls Jerry on his cellphone and tries to convince him to tell her where he is so Rick can pick him up. Jerry tells Beth nothing is wrong and that he is just buying lights at the store. However, Rick notices that he is lying and freezes Beth using a special remote, and then tries to level with Jerry, but Jerry rebuffs Rick. As far as Jerry is concerned, his predicament is a \"win-win\": if he survives and returns home, it will be without Rick's help, but if he dies, it will be entirely Rick's fault. After Jerry hangs up, Rick decides to let Jerry try to get out on his own. Before unfreezing Beth, Rick activates a special gadget in his lair, which created a disfigured, fungus-grown Jerry head, whom he uses to trick Beth into thinking that her husband was okay.This bar has a lot of ceiling fans.Meanwhile, in a bar, Jerry walks in, carrying a boulder into a bar and looks for a driver. The bartender and patrons tell Jerry he can\u2019t bring the boulder in with him. When Jerry drops the boulder, he floats up to the ceiling, where he is knocked around by multiple ceiling fans; the bartender and patrons tell him this isn\u2019t allowed, either. The patrons end up throwing Jerry out of the bar, causing him to immediately fly up into the sky again.A grotesque Terminator-esque robot comes to save the Smiths.Back at the house, Morty is in his room when a snake-shaped robot teleports to his position. The robot attempts to kill Morty, but a snake enters the room wielding a shotgun. The snake and robot fight with each other, and Morty runs to the garage, where he warns Beth and Rick about the snakes. Beth and Rick are initially skeptical at first, but when snakes and snake robots start appearing in the room and trying to kill Morty, they quickly get the message. Beth, Rick, and Morty grab weapons and try to kill the snakes, which keep attacking in growing numbers. A humanoid snake robot arrives to tell the family, but Beth crushes him to death in a panic. Morty asks Rick why the snakes would attack him when he was just trying to help them. Rick angrily responds that by sending Slippy to masquerade as the original astronaut, instead of leaving well enough alone, Morty unwittingly informed the snakes that there was something bigger and scarier to unite against. Now, instead of falling into the Dark Ages for a couple of generations, select snakes create new technology such as time travel in an attempt to kill him.In other words, none of this chaos would be possible if Morty simply did what Rick said in space and stayed in the car.All hail Morty.True to Rick's words, some time in the Snake Planet's future, the war costs the lives of 17 billion snakes by the end. Soon after, a newTerminator-esque war rages between snakes and machines. The surviving snakes from the previous war managed to defeat the machines in part because Morty somehow helped unite them.Chaos in the Snake PentagonBack at the Snake Planet, Rick and Morty land on the planet where the war between snakes and machines is in its earliest stage. Rick and Morty fight their way into the Snake Pentagon, where they defeat robots and snake soldiers alike. They briefly see Slippy, who is being threatened by several time-traveling robot snakes and protected by time-traveling snakes, making her a central source of the conflict that can determine the planet's fate.Snake M.I.T. in 1985They then reach the center of \u201cSnakenet\u201d, where a time machine is under construction. They kill the scientists making the time machine, but they realize that it is not even a quarter finished, Rick makes a mental note to blueprint time travel in a format snakes can understand or, in his case, \"committing more to Morty's current 'fuck-ups' \". As he said that, future versions of Rick and Morty show up with a book full of instructions on time travel written in the snakes\u2019 language, portable time machines, and snake costumes. Future Morty, who is sporting a black eye, rudely insults current Morty, and future Rick insults current Rick. Future Rick and Future Morty then leave. Rick and Morty put on the snake costumes, travel back to 1985, and leave the time travel instructions at Snake MIT before returning to the present, hoping the snakes' own self discovery will be their undoing.After they leave, a snake student and his peers read the time travel instructions and use them to build a time machine. They send a student back to the 19th century to prevent Snake Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination, sending him a letter which told him to duck, preventing his assassination. The student returns victorious, only to find that the ripple-effect of protecting Lincoln has altered the timeline and caused his present to be ruled by Snake Nazis.Snake time travel chaosNot taking any chances, the student grabs a chainsaw and steps back into the time machine. In 1938, Snake Adolf Hitler is giving a speech in Snake Berlin. He then goes inside to take a shower. A series of snake time travelers show up\u2014 some seeking to kill Snake Hitler, others seeking to protect him, or just fight one another as Snake Hitler stares at them in confusion. The time travelers start killing each other, leading to pandemonium.On earth in the present, Jerry briefly calls Beth to ask for help. When she doesn\u2019t answer, he leaves a voicemail promising to come home with \u201cthe best Christmas lights ever!\u201d He grabs ahold of a jet, which he holds onto when the neutral buoyancy wears off. A snake-human hybrid robot approaches Jerry and offers to save his life; Jerry, thinking the robot is from Rick, kicks it away, causing it to fly into the plane\u2019s engine. The plane careens toward the ground\u2014 Jerry jumps away at the last minute, grabs a tree, and climbs to safety.Back on earth in the present, time-traveling snakes and snake robots are raining down on the suburbs, still fighting to the death. Summer & Beth are hard at work killing them, but to no avail. Morty worries that giving snakes time travel just made it worse, but Rick reassures him that things will work out in their favor, knowing what would happen next.4th Dimensional Time Cop HeadquartersIn the fourth dimension, Shleemypants receives a phone call, informing him of the incident. He and another time cop travel to the snake planet and go back in time until they find the first snake to use tools. They proceed to beat that snake to death, thereby preventing the snake civilization (as we know it) from ever developing. In the present on earth, all the attacking snakes and snake robots suddenly disappear, the ones that haven't fallen writhing in pain before involuntarily eating their own tails. As this counted as one of Morty's adventures, Rick pulls out the card, but this time, he tears it apart, declaring that there are no freebies because of what happened.The only way to tie up a time travel story is ouroboros, or basically dealing with the source of the problemJerry reveals himself to be on the roof, and claims he was there the entire time. He then promptly falls off and breaks his leg. Rick heals the leg halfway, claiming that the other fifty percent is on him. He then remarks to Morty that Jerry sucks, yet Morty does not challenge this assertion Rick, Morty, and the family go inside to have some eggnog, only for the former two to once again encounter their future selves, who rudely remind them that they need to make snake costumes and translate time travel instructions into the snakes\u2019 language. Both Rick and Morty resign themselves to doing this.Merry Christmasssss.In the post-credits scene, they finish the instructions and time machines and travel to the snake planet to hand off the instructions, but before doing so, Rick punches Morty in the eye while reminding him to stay in the car next time. This resolves the causality loop and explains Morty\u2019s black eye.Unknown voicesNon-speaking charactersStarringRick: \"That's right, Morty; only 19 billion snakes can do that!\"Summer: \"You love it?

A conductor with a red misshapen nose says \"Tickets, please\" and takes his ticket. The man sits down at the bar. A second man sits next to him and asks the bartender for a drink for his \"colleague\", presuming they are both on the train to kill Rick Sanchez. He suggests to the first man that they swap stories and begins his own.In the story, the second man is seated on a throne of skulls and orders his minions to lower a prisoner into a vat of acid. Rick enters. The man asks Rick how Rick found him; Rick responds to his questions with farts. The man orders his minions to attack Rick, who quickly defeats his attackers. The man from the bar says, \"Now *I'll* fight you!\" Uncharacteristically, Rick looks scared and flees.Back on the train, the second man now asks the first man why he's going to kill Rick; the first man replies annoyed that he doesn't know any Rick Sanchez. As others begin telling their own stories of Rick, the first man leaves the dining car. In the next car, the man encounters a circle of storytellers regaling one another with heartwarming tales of Rick's good deeds. Goomby, one of the storytellers, relates the story of how Rick saved \"Space Christmas\". The group laughs appreciatively, then aggressively demands the man should tell his own \"Christmas Rick\" story. The first man angrily declines and threatens them with his gun so that he can leave the car.Entering the next car, he encounters a blonde woman wearing a low-cut top, whom he threatens to shoot if she cues up a Rick vignette. In explaining she doesn't know how she got there, she begins a cutaway story in which she enters a train car (the conductor appears from behind a plant and takes her ticket) and meets an older woman who asks her why she dated Rick Sanchez. The older woman embarks on her own cutaway story about when Rick met her family, which is interrupted by a warning shot from the man's gun. He admonishes the blonde woman for beginning a vignette; she protests that she wasn't trying to. The man begins to monologue about the train amplifying and linking narratives. When the woman becomes distracted by her own cleavage, the man realizes what's happening, and the two reveal themselves to be Rick and Morty in disguise.Rick explains they are stuck in a literal story device, an anthology. The conductor enters. Pointing his gun, Rick tells him to stop the train, but the conductor turns out to be a powerful fighter. After he skillfully uses Morty as a human shield, Rick instead shoots the train window, sucking the conductor half out the window.The conductor is suddenly in an arcade. He pulls off a helmet attached to a game (which he's just lost) called \"Tickets Please\". He returns to his family but doesn't believe anything is real. Moments later the top half of his body tears away bloodily and begins to pirouette toward the arcade ceiling, spraying blood everywhere. The scene cuts back to outside the train, where the window Rick shot has cut the pirouetting conductor in half.Rick plugs the hole in the window, but so much air has gone that the train deploys \"emergency continuity\" as oxygen masks that drop down. Rick breathes in, then takes the large tank connected to the masks labeled \"Continuity\". Train police break in, threaten Rick and Morty to tee up a story about Rick and end up shooting the tank, which explodes.Cut to a police training class, which is using the last scene as an educational tool. But Rick and Morty are suddenly among the students. They subdue the students and the teacher, and Rick finds a diagram labeled \"Anthology\" in the teacher's desk that shows a circle with eight segments (Dan Harmon's \"story circle\").The train rumbles, signaling an act break and a musical number with Rick and Birdperson. Via the continuing narrative of the pirouetting conductor at the arcade, the story winds its way back to Rick and Morty, wearing space suits and walking on the hull of the train. After putting the conductor out of his misery, Rick and Morty must disrupt the \"thematic seal\" by Morty telling an unrelated story. Morty eventually succeeds by telling a story of Summer and Beth fighting off scorpions with their period rays. The two of them make it into the train's engine compartment before Rick runs out of air, only to confront Story Lord (\"like a Matrix space Frasier\").Story Lord captures and binds them and reveals his plan: drain Rick and Morty of story potential to fuel the anthology train. After a series of cutaway narratives, modulated by Story Lord's control panel (which influences things like \"narrative energy\" and \"broad appeal\") , Rick and Morty find themselves in a final narrative that Story Lord views through a runed portal: the pair must face armies of Meeseeks, Citadel Guards, male Gazorpians and Evil Morty. Rick defeats Story Lord's plans by telling Morty about Jesus Christ, his personal savior. The control panel drains of power, and the train grinds to a halt.As Veggie-Tales-like cartoon characters surround Rick and Morty, Story Lord jumps into the narrative through the portal to yell at them. Jesus Christ descends from the heavens and drives everyone to their knees, and Rick and Morty use the distraction to leap back through the portal, trapping Story Lord in the narrative. But when they try to restart the train, the controls crumble away, fake.Cut to Rick and Morty in the Smith living room looking at a glowing model train traveling in a circle. Morty has bought it for Rick at the Citadel. Rick expresses great happiness that Morty spent money and engaged in capitalism. In the train narrative, Story Lord is talking to Jesus Christ, who decides to escape by summoning magic blood. In the living room, the train short-circuits and derails.Rick grows angry that the train is broken. When Morty suggests that he could return the broken train, Rick gets angrier and tells Morty to buy another one instead, reminding him that \"nobody's out there shopping with this fucking virus !\"The post-credits scene is an ad for Story Train.Non-speaking charactersUnknown voicesStarringView a full transcript of this episode here .

Rick immediately understands the situation and kills their respective facehuggers. Neither know how they got to that point and Rick is dismissive of the parasitic alien species. That is, until they spot a shockingly developed city.While trying to find Rick's car ship, they find out that Morty's facehugger was a celebrated leader, while Rick's was a political-soapbox-YouTuber that was largely looked down on contemptuously by the alien society.The two find the space cruiser tied to a missle ship that would drop loads of the alien eggs on Earth. While they had originally tried to make a clean escape using the corpses of their facehuggers as disguises, they are quickly seen through. Rick and Morty manage to leave the planet after causing devestating destruction to the city and its people.The two are in a good mood, high off of guilt-free murder. As they enjoy breakfast, Beth asks about Summer. The two stutteringly make excuses and head back to the planet to look for Summer who they'd completely forgotten about.After causing more mayhem, the two find her being waited on and worshipped by the aliens. After having them arrested Summer goes to their prison cell and explains what happened after Rick and Morty stupidly got close to the facehugger eggs and got possessed.\nSummer, who's new \"thing\" was chewing on a toothpick, killed whatever facehugger tried to jump on her. She finds out that the facehuggers generally only lived about half an hour before laying eggs in their hosts and died an explosive death. Using that to her advantage, she reasonably coaxes a new way of life, where they didn't all have to die just for the sake of laying eggs.Summer quickly becomes their ruler and appoints Morty's facehugger, Steve, as their inspired leader, using the technology from Rick's space cruiser to industrialise and create a technologically advanced society. Rick's facehugger, Bruce, grows jealous and leaves their growing government to make those anti-politic online videos. As things are going well, Steve and Summer chat in a friendly manner, talking about the missile ship with which they can spread eggs across the universe, before she brings up freeing her brother and replacing Steve as leader with Shane, a newly born facehugger. Steve realizes that all Summer wants is her family back and goes to Bruce to rant and complain.Bruce resentfully gives Steve an I-told-you-so, but Steve is exasperated with his social stance against their species' progressive life. Bruce exclaims that he was angry that Summer had taken Steve away from him; revealing his jealousy.Although awkward at first, the two makeup with a sizzling kiss and plan to runaway together. That's when Rick and Morty were freed.Her story done, Rick and Morty are a little bewildered that Summer would know how that second half of the story went, but she dismissively waves it off. Everyone around the office knew about Steve and Bruce.Summer's plan for escape is sentencing the two to death... by way of leaving in Rick's car. And of course, Summer had to go with them to make sure they died. The facehugger society is not stupid however and catches on that they're all just trying to escape. When they were jailed, Rick and Morty discover that Morty's terrible harmonica playing causes the aliens to combust. So, using the car's speakers they massacre even more of the aliens before finally leaving the planet.When they reach home, Summer goes back to her room and Rick and Morty retire to the living room. For a moment they believe the aliens really had laid eggs in them and they were going to explode. But it just turned out that they both just actually shitted theirselvesAfter the end credits, Tricia watches Jerry keeping bees in the garden from Summers bedroom window, after she increasingly implies she\u2019s sexually attracted to him to Summer, she finally says she wants to have sex with him to a bored and annoyed Summer; who sarcastically responds \"Oh,really?\".View a full transcript of this episodehere.

During the flight, Morty mentions that Rick might be setting him up for a double-cross. Morty seems done with Rick's shenanigans. Rick tells Morty that they don't have to worry - and as a last ditch effort, if things \"go wrong\", that he's got a plan, and tells Morty to leap into the same vat of acid he does. Morty still complains, and says he should be doing English homework. However, Rick doesn't budge and resumes the ride.Rick meets up with some intergalactic barters who he trades with. All seems well until the dealer tells Rick he's been duped, and that they successfully scammed Rick. Angered by this, Rick forms a third arm and shoots a dealer in the head. However, still held at gunpoint, Rick and Morty are forced to jump in the vat of fake acid that he prepared in advance. Rick and Morty sink to the bottom of the vat of acid, and open up predetermined hatches in order to trick the dealers into thinking that they died. The dealer and his cronies take time to watch the bones settle. They are in shock that a grandfather would commit suicide with his grandson, and mourn over Morty's death. Rick and Morty lie in wait at the bottom of the vat, until the dealer and his cronies vanish. Morty begins to get impatient after an extended period of time, as the dealers take the time for self-reflection and then decide of the bones, and takes it upon himself to rise out of the acid and kill the dealers. He misfires, and Rick takes the gun from him and kills all of the cronies. They then make a getaway.Morty begins to get mad at Rick's faulty plan, and that Rick should be more open-minded instead of falling back on himself all of the time. Rick argues that he was able to handle things all by himself when he was turned into a pickle, and that Morty's adventure with the dragon was a total disaster. Morty then waves the fact that Rick likes to ignore most ideas Morty pitches over his head. As the argument escalates, it turns out that Rick has already refused Morty's request for a device that would allow him to save a point in time (like that of a video game), so that Morty can visit said time restarts. Rick, in a fit of rage, reluctantly agrees. Shortly after, Rick admits that he actually is unable to make said device, and proceeds to shoot Morty. After being shot Morty is still breathing - suggesting he was stunned - however, Rick triggers the device creating the first time stamp and encourages an oblivious Morty to have fun with the device.Over the next few weeks, Morty has a lot of fun with his time-saving device - including pulling his teacher's pants down, talking to his love interest Jessica, avoiding embarrassing moments, rectifying bad decisions and saving himself from death. One day, he activates the time save before approaching a girl outside of a coffee shop to talk to her. They get along well and go on a date, which leads to a long-term relationship. Morty and his (unnamed) girlfriend go through many ups and down over the following months, and even break-up at one point, but emerge stronger than ever. The two go on vacation together, but the plane they boarded on crashes and they get stranded on a mountain range. They are forced to resort to cannibalism to stay alive, and Morty starts trekking across the mountains to retrieve his backpack. Although he finds the time-save device, Morty decides not activate it, and uses his frost-bitten hands to call for a rescue. He is saved just in time, and after an extended stay in hospital Morty and his girlfriend fully recover from their ordeal. At their welcome home party, Morty and his girlfriend are happier and stronger than ever... until Jerry mistakes the time-save device for the TV remote and hits the buttons, 'restoring' Morty's save point back to before he approached his girlfriend. He tries to approach her again, but gets pepper-sprayed in the face for his troubles. In his pain, he falls on the time-save device and saves that point, leaving him unable to go back and try again.Depressed that the time-save has only made him more miserable, Morty throws himself to a bunch of gorillas at the local zoo a few times. Finally he goes to see Rick, sick and tired of restarting time, and decides to take these experiences as an opportunity to face the consequences of his actions.Rick however lets Morty know that his previous actions did, in fact, have consequences. Stating that he has never believed in time travel, reveals to Morty that the boy didn't perform any \"do-overs\", but rather \"did it, over and over\". Showing a recording of one of these \"do-overs\", Rick shows that all the \"time resets\" were actually different probabilities of him all along. This caused the death of numerous Morty's, moving the present Morty in their place, not unlike the moviePrestige. Disgusted with his actions, Morty is in a state of despair, as he doesn't know what to do or how to fix the mess he caused. Rick suggests that he can fuse all of his alternate selves and their respective universes. Fed up, Morty complies and Rick reveals that he is not Morty's original Rick but another Rick who says all Ricks have a vat of acid. He then merges the universes together and returns Morty to the first save point with his Rick. All of a sudden, a bunch of law enforcement members and protesters appear outside of Rick's garage, with anti-Morty posters (consequences of his actions in the other universes). Morty is terrified and confused, however Rick is determined to make Morty learn his lesson and tells him to jump into the fake vat of acid he's set up. Grumbling, Morty does so (just as his previous girlfriend arrives, only to leave in tears upon seeing Morty go into the acid) and hides at the bottom releasing fake bones just like he did before. Satisfied, and feeling a bit guilty, everybody vacates the premises except for the two cops. The cops seem to doubt Morty's death and drop a ladle in, and Morty's attempt to blow it up results in him accidentally shooting the cop in two and splashing his partner with the fake acid. The remaining cop, instead of coming to the logical conclusion, believes he's immune to acid and leaves happily after insulting and exposing himself to his dead partner. Rick is satisfied Morty has learned something: to \"never make fun of him again,ever\", and decides to head home (saying he wouldn't waste their home reality on this crap) lamenting that the reality they're in was nice, as Johnny Carson was still alive and on the air, 9/11 never happened and Rocky Road ice cream had peanut butter instead of marshmallows.In the post-credits scene, the surviving cop goes on Johnny Carson's show proclaiming that he is immune to acid. He is lowered into a genuine vat, where he suffers a slow and painful death.View a full transcript of this episode here .

During the drive, Rick gets a call from an ex telling him he is the father of her children. Beth, determined that Rick will do for his new child what he never did for her, forces him to go to his ex and be a good dad. However it turns out that Rick's ex, Gaia, is an entire planet about to give birth to her first sentient species. Beth wants Rick to help the kids develop, and Rick agrees so the two of them set to work developing the society and helping them fly into space.Morty, Summer and Jerry go camping, but Morty and Summer make it clear they have no intention of going along with Jerry's camping trip. After Summer verbally blasts Jerry for wanting to bond with her in order to feel important, he leaves forlorn and accidentally gets thrown into a group of Rick and Beth's new society's rejects. With their basic brains, they love the idea of camping, so Jerry becomes their new leader. Morty and Summer go looking for him after a few days, only to find a crashed alien ship. Boarding it, Morty believes the controls are identical to his video game while Summer thinks the vapor the ship emits will grant her knowledge of how the controls and begins inhaling it. Soon she gets high off of the substance, and Morty tries to fly the ship. Meanwhile, a god-like being named Reggie arrives claiming he is the father of the children that Beth and Rick raised, and Gaia admits to Rick she made a mistake and doesn't know who the father is. Rick and Reggie both want to lay claim to the offspring, and quickly get into a fight. After a long brawl, Reggie gets the upper hand and tells Rick he has no intention of raising his kids but simply wants to strike the fear of god (who, as far as he is concerned, is himself) into them. However before Reggie can kill Rick, Morty and Summer dispatch him by accidentally driving the spaceship through his brain. Boarding, Rick finds Morty and Summer high, and thanks them for saving his life. Rick tells them that video games and drugs are the best, although also points out Summer wasn't actually doing drugs, but rather - inhaling brake fluid. Rick soon inhales the brake fluid.While all this is going on, Beth's advanced Ricklets and Jerry's tribal Ricklets have gone to war with each other. However before the battle can go too far, Reggie's body falls on the city destroying it and killing many of the residents. Beth is sent flying over a cliff, and its left to Jerry to save her. He manages it, however the smell he now emits quickly quells any thought of thanking him for the rescue. Gaia is furious that her mate has been killed and forms an erupting volcano, the resulting lava killing most of the surviving society. Rick, Morty and Summer pick up Beth, Jerry and the last few survivors and fly off. The family finally leaves in their car, and gives the ship to the Ricklets (which Rick placing a tracer and a bomb on board, planning to blow it up if they come near Earth seeking revenge).As the family flies off, Jerry reveals that he has learned a lesson from the experience, and tells the kids they were right about him, as he admits that he wanted to feel important, something that left Summer and Morty shocked. Jerry says there are times, where teenagers do have a point even if they are cruel, leaving the kids to feel guilty at their treatment. After Rick insults Jerry, Beth for once doesn't defend her father - and instead takes her husband's defense by voicing how Jerry saved her life, while criticizing Rick. This brings a smile to Jerry's face, and as Rick observes Jerry's smug look, Rick takes the opportunity to put them in their place and reassert control - telling Jerry and Beth they need to work on their parenting skills as Morty and Summer got high, went joyriding and killed Reggie. Beth and Jerry appear to be shocked and displeased that Rick is ratting out their kids who are equally shocked until listening to criticism.In the post-credits scene, Summer catches Rick looking at what appears to be a dating/porn website for planets. Although Rick claims he's only looking at it for the comedic potential, he's clearly aroused by what he sees.View a full transcript of this episodehere.

Beth quickly ended most of them leaving one guard alive. She told the guard her name and tells him to say that the Defiance lives on to the top bugs. The bug guard agrees ensuring that he would make her a legend although it was making it difficult for him to construct such an idea since Beth's name is so plain. The bug guards then forgets Beth's name but then Beth kills him.The next scene appears to be a secret base where Beth is stationed. Beth is being repaired on her shoulder while watching an ad about a planet-destroying machine. The doctor who is repairing Beth's arm tells Beth if she ever missed Earth. Beth tells him that she's aware that there was a clone of her on Earth making her \"technically\" there. The doctor points out that Beth had a proximity device in her neck. He thinks that the bomb indicated that Rick didn't actually want Beth back and that he liked the clone better. He then offers Beth a drug to help her with her \"soul-crushing\" but it was addictive. But he swaps out for the correct one and then he eats one.Now back on Earth, Beth is talking about Dr. Wong being open for family therapy. Rick then tries to act as if he was disintegrated but Morty points out that Rick simply used an invisibility belt. Jerry proves this by grabbing Rick's crouch causing Rick to uncloak. Morty says that he wanted to use the belt even though Rick never let him. Summer pitched in saying that if she can use the belt to piss of Morty. Rick gives Summer the belt with a smug look towards Morty. Summer turns invisible as Morty tries to take it from Summer. Beth stops Morty and says that both Summer and Morty should share it. Jerry enters with a puppet \"Mr. Nibbles\". Morty then runs to catch Summer as she leaves the front door. Rick says to both Jerry and Beth that they can't control their kids and that it was a good thing Dr. Wong was available. Rick leaves the scene and enters into his garage where he commanded the garage into \"Family Therapy Mode\".The garage seals all openings with lasers and doors. However, the other version of Beth stands before Rick. Space Beth attacks Rick explains that the Beth on Earth has a similar device in her neck meant to transfer her Memories to space Beth and that Earth Beth is the clone. Space Beth is confused about why her clone got back together with Jerry, but Rick explains that, as they are the same person, she would have done the same thing. The two then decide to get a drink.Meanwhile, Summer uses the invisibility belt to break into a boy's room and go through his stuff, however, Morty stops and confronts her wearing a pair of infrared goggles. The two wrestle for a short time before managing to switch tech. Morty is going to leave with the belt, but Summer reveals that she knows that Morty is planning to go to cheerleading practice and can catch him in the act. Morty asks summer for a deal, with her saying that he can have the belt in an hour. He agrees and hands her the belt, but instead of giving him the goggles, Summer she smashes them before mocking Morty, only for him to reveal that he gave her his \"Tiny Big Man Junior\" belt instead of the invisibility one. Morty then proceeds to turn invisible before leaving, leaving Summer to confront the boy whose room she broke into. Summer lies to the boy about having wandered away from her game console.Rick and Space Beth converse at Shoney's, with Beth talking about her adventures and Rick pointing out how they seem similar to Star Wars. In turn, Beth brags about how she has become the most wanted person in the universe, much to Rick's surprise. The two are interrupted when they see a television report about the New Galactic Federation looking for Beth. Realizing that they would find Earth Beth, Rick lets it slip that Earth Beth might not be the clone. Space Beth attempts to shoot Rick, but he freezes her.At the school, Morty uses the invisibility belt to try and peek on the cheerleaders in the shower, but Summer, knowing he would be there, pulls the fire alarm and sprays a fire extinguisher, coating Morty in the foam. Morty runs into the football field, and tries to clean himself off, Summer uses the opportunity to steal the belt and turn invisible. Morty tries to use the fire extinguisher on her, but it turns out to be empty. A New Galactic Federation ship then approaches, causing Morty to drop the fire extinguisher. Morty is about to be arrested, but a still invisible Summer picks up the fire extinguisher. Surprised the federation agents ask if Morty psychic, to which he lies and says yes. They explain they are looking for his mother and then ask of Morty can stop their hearts. Morty lies again, saying he can, and the agents then surrender without a fight.Meanwhile, Dr. Wong chastises Jerry's obsession with puppets as it makes him look dumb and crazy. Suddenly, the room explodes as Tammy and a team of Galactic Federation troopers storm the building with the intent of gong after Beth. While Tammy wants to kill Beth, she's under orders by her superiors to bring her in and arrest her for her defiance. Beth doesn't understand what Tammy means, but after seeing Space Beth's battle, she realizes that she's the clone all along. Suddenly, Rick arrives and has his smart guns kill everybody but the humans inside the building, including, to his reluctance, Dr. Wong. While Tammy holds Beth prisoner, Rick reveals that he added a lot of contingency plans inside the office, using one to burn Tammy alive before shooting her. Rick takes Jerry and Beth in his ship and flies away.As the trio fly, they are followed by Space Beth and Galactic Federation ships. While Jerry suggests that Rick make a portal for safety, the latter refuses to as Morty and Summer are still out there invisible, before calling him a bad father. However, Beth calls Rick out on his hypocritical statement as he lied to her about being a clone, only for the latter to hesitatingly claim that Space Beth is the clone as Beth refused to leave, and he liked the idea of having a space daughter. Tired of being lied to, Beth crashes Rick's ship so she can speak with Space Beth, with both versions accusing the other of being the clone. Before Space Beth can kill Beth, a burned Tammy and a squad of Galactic Federation troopers surround them. Rather than decide which is which, Tammy simply has both Beths taken away on a NX-5 Planet Remover. Rick tries to sacrifice himself as he believes the Galactic Federation still thinks he's a high-value target, but Tammy reveals that the new leaders do not deem him that anymore as they know he could simply move to a new dimension when left alone. Suddenly, Tammy's gun is pulled away from her, and Morty, in a Galactic Federation ship, fires at the troopers. He reveals to Rick that he and Summer, who is invisible right now, have put aside their differences and are working together as part of their \"arc\". After an invisible Summer takes Tammy down, Rick shoots her in the head as payback for making him go to a wedding, along with killing Birdperson which he realized should have been the first thing he said. However, the NX-5 begins to destroy the Earth, with a pissed and reluctant Rick realizing they have to do a \"Star Wars\" in order to rescue Beth.Rick and the family land in the NX-5's hanger bay and use Tammy's corpse to unlock the door to the main hallway. While Rick goes off to find Beth, he tells Morty and Summer to stop the NX-5 from destroying the city. However, the siblings are forced to leave without the invisibility belt as Jerry is using it to pee, but Morty is certain that they don't need it.In their prison cell, the Beths wonder what their fate will be as Earth Beth feels she's the clone to Space Beth. After the two trade insults over their decisions on who they became, Rick announces to on the PA that he's coming to save one of the Beths if they are alive, but if they're both alive, then he suggests that they do not hurt each other as anyone of them could be the clone. Now realizing what a piece of shit father Rick is, the Beths escape their prison cell.Rick enters a fight chamber and sees his old friend Birdperson, now Phoenixperson, come out to face him. Although dishearten to see his old friend now on the Galactic Federation's side, he tries to calm Phoenixperson by saying that he killed Tammy. However, Phoenixperson is not happy with this news as he loved Tammy, and the two begin fighting each other.Meanwhile, Morty and Summer find the laser controls, only to see two Galactic Federation troopers guarding it. They see that the NX-5 cannons are unable to destroy Wrangler jeans due to their sponsorship, which gives Morty and Summer an idea. Meanwhile, Rick and Phoenixperson continue their fight, but Rick starts to get overwhelmed by the latter.Elsewhere, the two Beths work together and fight their way through Galactic Federation troopers to reach Rick. Back at the cannon station, Morty distracts the two guards by running past the doorway, leading them out of the room. That gives Summer the chance to go in and toss Morty's Wrangler jeans into the laser well, and the computer shuts down because of it. Morty comes back after killing the two guards off-screen, but Summer is disgusted to have seen her brother's balls.Meanwhile, Rick and Phoenixperson's fight goes outside, with the former getting blasted at and having his cybernetic guts ooze out of his body. Before Phoenixperson can kill Rick, the Beths arrive to help him, or at least kick his ass before he dies. However, it's not enough as Phoenixperson knocks the Beths out of the way before stomping on Rick's organs. Suddenly, Jerry comes out invisible and uses Tammy's corpse as a puppet, claiming that Rick lied about killing her, distracting Phoennixperson. While Jerry trips up and goes visible, his actions were long enough for Space Beth to shut off Phoenixperson. Afterwards, Morty and Summer come and see their two mothers.Back at home, the Smith family is okay with the idea of having two Beths as the kids like the idea of having two moms, and Jerry likes the idea of having two wives. However, Rick has a projector ready to reveal who the real Beth is, and shows that he mind-blew his memory of the reveal. That upsets the Beths even more as they now realize how much of a piece of shit Rick is, and refuse to look at the memory, claiming they don't need anything from Rick before leaving. Rick tries to entice Morty and Summer into seeing it, but they are not interested either as both Beths are badass and it's a win-win. Regardless, Rick puts the memory into the projector and watches the memory.It turns out that after giving Beth the choice of staying on Earth or going off on her own, she asks Rick to make the choice for her as she wants to know what he really wants. Rick ends up making a clone of Beth and copies her memories into the clone, but then, he turns his back to the containers and has a machine randomize the Beth's so he could not tell who was who.After seeing this, Rick despondently realizes that he's a terrible father, before looking at the pieces of Phoenixperson, having recovered his old friend from the NX-5. However, Phoenixperson is still hostile towards Rick, forcing the latter to turn off his friend. Afterwards, Rick sits down, despondent that his actions have driven himself further from his family more than ever.In the post-credits scene, Jerry throws Rick's invisibility belt in the trash, only for it to turn the garbage truck invisible when it picks up the trash. A rich man then arrives driving his fast car and, despite Jerry's warnings, crashes into the invisible truck. Though he is glad that he survived, the car then explodes, killing him and causing the truck's drivers to flee terrified. Jerry proceeds to claim the invisible truck for himself, and becomes a vigilante, performing several \"heroic\" feats, such as saving a prostitute from a pimp. However, when the truck runs out of gas, Jerry is forced to abandon it at a gas station, having been unable to find its fuel tank.View a full transcript of this episode here .

However, their ship and its controls are damaged beyond repair, and Rick passes out from his wounds before he can fix it. Realizing they're about to die either through re-entry or by the impact, Morty decides to call Jessica and confess his feelings for her, blaming the timing for not doing it sooner. However, Jessica reveals that she was interested in Morty for some time now, and asks to visit his house to watch a movie. Revitalized by this revelation, Morty tries to regain control of the ship, which he does at the last second, but he hits a palm tree that catapults him back into the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the nature of his wounds, Rick wakes up and sees where they landed, and in a panic, tries to flee with Morty, but is too late as his old arch-nemesis, Mr. Nimbus, appears and cries foul at Rick for violating an ancient treaty.Back at the Smith Residence, Rick is frustratingly preparing the table for dinner between himself and Mr. Nimbus. Despite Morty's attempts to get out of it, Rick assigns him to be \"booze guy\" for the dinner as he leaves a few crates of wine in a \" Narnia-like Dimension \" as Mr. Nimbus prefers his wine aged to a few centuries. Mr. Nimbus arrives and controls the police to do random things after Jerry tries to call them to get him out of the house. Jessica arrives shortly after and is hurriedly rushed to the living room by Morty and gets her to choose anything she wants from the TV while he deals with Mr. Nimbus' demands for wine. Back at the Narnia Dimension, he encounters a couple who kept the wine safe for a few decades and give him love advice for his date with Jessica. However, once he returns, Mr. Nimbus consumes them both in a split second and orders Morty to get more, to his dismay. He goes back, only to find the deranged son of the couple he met just a few minutes earlier trying to kill him for the murder of his parents. Morty briefly leaves to regain his composure before returning, and kills the couple's now elderly son in front of his children. Realizing he told them the truth, they apologize to him shortly before dying of his wounds, and made a blood oath to kill Morty should he return.As time goes by, the farm evolves into a fortress and then the fortress into a castle, with all of its inhabitants bent on killing Morty. They believe they accomplish this when he returns for more wine and they open fire on him forcing him to retreat. Fed up with all these setbacks, Morty equips himself with every weapon and armor he can get and massacres the entire castle of its inhabitants in a fit of rage. He finds the remainder of the wine and heads back, unaware that he left his levitation glove behind for a group of survivors to pick up.Finally done with all that, Morty gives all the wine to Mr. Nimbus, save for one bottle, which he smuggles to the living room for himself and Jessica to share. He tries to apologize for making her wait, but she ignores all that and kisses him. Before this can progress any further, they decide to drink up the wine and find a bottle opener, but Rick tries to drag him away to be a witness to the \"contract\" that he and Nimbus are making. At the same time a dog-horse specimen named Adam (who is the son of the woman who found Morty's levitation glove in the ruins of the castle following its destruction at Morty's hands) dons a power suit, opens a portal and arrives in the kitchen with the intent to kill Morty. Despite his best efforts (and after being distracted by Mr. Nimbus), he is defeated by Jessica, who after finding the bottle opener, uses it to stab the tube connected to his suit. This causes his suit to implode (following a brief vision where Adam encounters a giant owl-like creature) and in turn, causes the tube to sever, flail and connect with the bottle opener which Jessica continued to hold in her left hand and consequently, sucks Jessica head first into the Narnia Dimension as it returns to it's point of origin.Meanwhile, Rick and Mr. Nimbus fight over terms when Rick snaps and yells at Mr. Nimbus, claiming he doesn't need anyone or him to make him feel better, though Nimbus suggests that he's turned into a hollow shell of himself because of Diane, causing Rick to strangle him. Meanwhile, Morty is tricked by robots into capture and sees Jessica, seemingly unconscious, encased in a crystal above him. While the scientist robot monologues as to why the society before them picked him for petty vengeance, Morty is able to break free of his restraints and free Jessica in the process. On the way back, they're surrounded by robots. Rick sees Morty and Jessica struggling to break free from a robotic tentacle and attempts to rescue them just to get rid of Mr. Nimbus, but he is dragged into the dimension as well and his weapons are stripped from him, forcing him to run into an enclosure with Morty and Jessica. Just as it all seemed lost, a huge wave of water along with an army of sea creatures rushes in and engulfs the entire dimension. It's revealed that Mr. Nimbus had secretly followed Rick and rescued him from the robots, causing Rick to reconcile with him.Back at the residence, Rick and Mr. Nimbus have started to get along well when Summer returns with a conch shell she acquired from fighting deep-sea creatures in the Mariana Trench, completely ruining their relationship once again, and Mr. Nimbus beats up Rick before controlling the police to arrest him. At the same time, Jessica, who unfortunately, is revealed to have actually been fully conscious for the centuries of time she spent in the crystal, has opened up to time and begins to philosophically rant to herself before calling off the date with Morty, saying they should just be friends. As she walks into the night, she flips off a nearby driver and declares herself to be a time god.Afterwards, Beth and Jerry head to Mr. Nimbus' place to take up an offer to a threesome with him after seeing his approval of them as a \"progressive couple\" earlier. They start to have some doubts on pulling through with it until Mr. Nimbus opens the door, and the couple sheepishly dive into his arms."}, "42": {"title": "Mortyplicity", "text": "Rick and the family are eating when Rick tells the family God is real and has been sleeping for thousands of years, and he and Morty are going to sneak up into the clouds and kill him. Beth tells everyone Jerry is getting a job. Rick points this out as something wrong, then squid-like creatures break into the house and shoot everyone one by one. Somewhere else, Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted is asking to be hunted, and the family tries to grab him until Rick's watch activates an alarm, showing that someone just killed a decoy family.In the car, Rick explains that squid people are trying to hunt him down, and since the Space Beth incident, he has created various decoy families in various places around the country to protect themselves from any possible killers attempting to murder the family. However, the Smiths begin to argue, and as they do, the squids attack them from above and proceed to shoot their car to bits. However, they are quickly revealed as a decoy family. Another family is in Italy on vacation, and are ambushed and killed. In yet another house, a Rick and Morty notice that their decoy family has been destroyed and lock the house shut and proceed to watch a show about a time-travelling werewolf called'When Wolf'on interdimensional cable. However, their commentary on the show is interrupted when more squid people attack them, bombarding their house regardless of the security.In yet another version of the Smith Residence, another Smith family takes notice. The five of them talk about it, and Summer asks if they are decoys themselves. This scares Rick as he tells Morty to check for a number on his butt. Morty looks and Rick farts. Jerry comes out with gluten-free, sugar-free, and lemon-free lemon squares, and Rick flies them in his Space Cruiser to one of the decoy houses. He enters and says the password, freezing them in place. Morty finds that the decoys are making decoys. Rick goes to his decoy and re-activates his head to ask questions before deactivating the being entirely. They drive around the countryside, and spot another Smith Residence created by another Rick, except Rick does not remember building them. They go to investigate, and another Rick says his password, freezing the other decoys. Seeing this, the first family hides as a second family comes into the scene. The second family unfreezes their decoy to ask questions, but realize that others are among them. Both sides accuse the other of being a decoy family, and they proceed to brawl, only to be destroyed by a fourth Rick and his family.After Rick briefly explains what is happening, they disguise themselves as their mysterious squid opponents and shoot one of the ships down. They proceed to loot their ship, only to realize that the squids were actually a decoy family in disguise. A decoy Jerry throws a bomb, incinerating them. The commotion caused by the various decoy families has made various versions of themselves worried if they are decoys or real, leading to various deaths and families checking to see if they are real or not. One family is in the woods, fleeing the commotion when they are tranquilized by another decoy who takes them to his version of the Smith Residence. The decoy reveals himself to be a scarecrow-like version that was so poorly-made that he knew he was fake from the moment he was created; he harvests the skin of decoys to look more like them, and provides skin for his own version of the Smith family.However, before he can skin them alive, a Glockenspiel version of the Smith family intervenes, saving the other Smith family from the scarecrow versions. They do not care for killing other decoys, instead saving as many as they can. They take their counterparts into a canyon, where a community of various decoys hides underground. The squids attack them, causing Glockenspiel Jerry to lock himself in the escape route with a can of varnish, effectively leaving the decoys to die. As another family kills a few decoys, their Rick ultimately decides to end the cycle by creating an Andross-styled beacon to attract the various decoys towards his version of the Smith Residence, all of which proceed to engage in an all-out battle royale, killing each other one by one until only one remains standing.Yet another version of the Smith family, disguised as lazily made decoys, take off their disguises and go into their Space Cruiser to investigate. However, one of the remaining versions shoots them from above, forcing them to fight. Ultimately, the ones that crashed win, but they are all killed by Mister Always Wants To Be Hunted, who was angered by the fact that he wasn't being hunted.Up in space, what is presumably the real Smith family is wrapping up on an adventure with Space Beth when Rick's watch goes off, revealing the decoys were killed off once more, raising questions from his family.Meanwhile, Glockenspiel Jerry escapes into the wilderness, takes off his clothes, puts the whole can of varnish onto himself and goes down the river. However, he is soon spotted by a group of beavers who use him as a crib for baby beavers. The water floods, putting him to sleep and he wakes to see he is stranded in a wasteland. The descendants of a dolphin and a woodpecker, who speak of him as a relic from a kinder past, take him to their place. Then, he wakes up as part of the ornament of a saloon mirror and sees green, reptilian cowboys who are surprised at him and burn him alive. Finally, he awakens a third time to see yellow humanoids living in their version of the Roman Empire and reenacting the origin of Christianity. Glockenspiel Jerry awakens embedded on the cross of the yellow humanoid Jesus, laments his inability to die and says that this the worst thing that ever happened to anyone."}, "43": {"title": "A Rickconvenient Mort", "text": "While out buying custom t-shirts, Rick and Morty are assaulted by acid rain caused by a cartoonish villain named Diesel Weasel . He is attacked by a Captain Planet-esque superhero named Planetina , who defeats him with her elemental powers, impressing Morty. When Rick tosses an aluminum can on the ground, Morty recycles it, attracting her attention. He awkwardly invites her on a date, to which she accepts, flying away with him and shocking Rick.At breakfast sometime later, Beth expresses concern at the idea of Morty dating a woman who looks much older than him, which he shrugs off. Summer laments Morty's success with women while she has been recently broken up with, and Rick invites her on a bar crawl across three planets that are all about to end via natural disaster, to which she accepts, despite Jerry's objections. Morty receives news of a wildfire and ignores Beth's protest, going to it with the hope that he may see Planetina.He arrives just as she stops the fire and the two express their mutual attraction to each other. She mentions having \"kids,\" but is actually referring to the Tina-teers, four people who carry elemental rings and summon her using them. The Tina-teers arrive on the scene, and Morty realizes that they control, exploit, and profit off of Planetina. While Planetina is being interviewed by a news team, the interviewer notices Morty and asks if they are dating. Planetina hesitates, but Morty claims that they are, to her delight.As they fly to the first planet, Rick and Summer make a \"no attachments\" deal in regards to any sexual encounters they may have. They arrive at the first planet, Morglutz. While there, Rick finds himself attracted to an alien named Daphne , and goes off to have sex with her. Summer shouts after him to have fun and reminds him to not get attached.At night, Morty stays up flirting with Planetina over text. He thanks her for the flowers she sent him, which are a massive amount grown to look like his face. She appears outside his window and the two have sex. As Summer and Rick leave Morglutz and the planet is destroyed, she hears a noise coming from the trunk, which Rick brushes off.At a convention called Eco-Con, the Tina-teers summon Planetina to host a panel, but Morty is taken with her during the summoning, the two still asleep together. The Tina-teers dispel her and security drags Morty away. The fire elemental, Eddie, assures the dirt elemental that he will deal with Morty. On the second planet, Slartivart, Summer realized Rick has taken Daphne with him, leaving her furious at the violation of the rules.Morty, meanwhile, is tied up in a broom closet by security. Eddie reveals his plan to sell Planetina to a rich Arabic ambassador. He lights a mop on fire and attempts to burn Morty's face, but Morty knocks him down, frees himself, bites Eddie's finger off, and burns him and two guards alive with his own ring. He breaks into the conference room where Planetina is being sold, and kills the rest of the Tina-teers with their own rings, as well as two more guards and the ambassador.After the destruction of Slartivart, Summer struggles to ignore Rick and Daphne having sex in the back of the car. During a break, Daphne talks to Summer, revealing why Rick is so attracted to her: she has a pair of breasts on each of her elbows. Summer remains confident that Rick will dump her upon reaching the third planet, but Daphne casually disagrees.At home, Morty reveals that he has invited Planetina to live with the family now that she is free from the Tina-teers. Beth is still disheartened by the age gap of the two and demands Planetina leave. Morty, enraged, confesses his love for her, and the two leave together, going off to stop natural disasters and environmental destruction. However without anyone reigning her in, Planetina becomes more violent, slashing the tires on a highway full of cars, burning down a congressman's mansion, and killing a mine full of workers in a fit of rage, horrifying Morty.On the last planet, Ferkus 9, the citizens are having a planet-wide orgy while Rick and Daphne dance together. Summer tries to dissuade him, telling him that Daphne is just using him, which he denies. She takes the ship and flies towards the asteroid about to crash into the planet, destroys it, and comes back down, asking Daphne if she will continue to stay with Rick now that they are no longer in danger. She casually leaves, shocking Rick. As they fly home, Summer apologizes, and Rick tells her that while he is angry at her, it was very like him of her to stop an apocalypse just to prove a point. When she apologizes again, he brushes it off and tells her he would do the same if she needed it.Morty, alone in his room, is visited by Planetina. She begs him to try and make their relationship work, but he refuses, too disgusted by her actions at the mine. She insists that violence is the only way to save the Earth before bringing up how he killed her \"kids\". Morty insists that while the Tina-Teers tried to heartlessly sell her and only did it to free her, the miners she incinerated were just doing their jobs. Planetina then confesses her love for him but he sadly rejects her declaration. When he asks her to try and understand, she curses him out tearfully and flies away. Beth, having heard the argument, comforts a weeping Morty who apologizes for not listening to her as the arrangement of flowers Planetina made of his face shows signs of decay. The song playing in the background is \u201c I Am the Antichrist to You \" by Kishi Bashi.In a post-credits scene, an alien from Ferkus 9 who had sex with his father, believing the world was going to end, arrives at work at a bakery the next day. The two awkwardly converse mentioning that the son's mother still won't talk to them for what they did before the son wishes him a happy birthday."}, "44": {"title": "Rickdependence Spray", "text": "While at Beth's workplace, Morty begs her to hurry up so they don't miss the movie (in Beth's words, \"the new Marvel shit that the kids are jizzing about\"), he notices the hospital's horse breeding mount. Curious, and to Beth's surprise, he quickly volunteers to work with her, with the purpose to use the mount to jerk him off. One week later, Morty relaxes at home, thinking back at his deed, before he notices a familiar barrel Rick brought back with him. To his shock, he learns that Rick borrowed a barrel of \"horse semen\" from the hospital to create a bioweapon, to be used on an underground race of cannibalistic horse people called \"chuds\" that he and Morty have been fighting. After Morty frantically convinces Rick not to test the semen to verify that it indeed belongs to a horse, Rick proceeds to work on his experiment. A power surge goes through it and the barrel explodes. When Morty comes to, he sees that the sperm have mutated into floating, toothy monsters that eat humans. Rick blames himself, believing he brought in a bad sample, much to Morty's guilt and relief.The family is airlifted to the Pentagon's war room by the President , where Morty agrees to lie for Rick and tells the President that they know nothing about the outbreak. The President brings in Professor Shabooboo , the world's leading expert on sperm, who theorizes that the sperm will head to the Grand Canyon because of its vaginal shape. When he brings in a captured sperm monster and announces that he intends to analyze it, Morty shoots it to cover his tracks. At Morty's suggestion, the President sends Rick, Morty, the country's nukes, and a helicopter full of Marines to the Grand Canyon. The sperm, rapidly evolving, shoot down the plane with a trebuchet.Rick, Morty, and two marines (one named Blazen that they believe to be incredibly cool) survive the crash, although the other marine is killed when the sperm attack. Morty saves a sperm with its tail stuck under a rock after it recognizes him as its creator, dubbing it \"Sticky\" . In the war room, Summer comes up with an idea to create a giant egg for the sperm to flock to, but has her idea stolen by Shabooboo. Blazen leads them into the caves where the sperm are hiding, and ends up stabbing himself in the chest and accidentally revealing that he wears a thong, shattering Rick and Morty's image of him. He asks Morty to not tell Sports Illustrated model Kathy Ireland that he is wearing her thong. He then attempts to perform autofelletio on himself before the sperm devour him. They then freeze Rick in crystallized semen and the two are led to a talking sperm in a mechanical suit known as the Sperm Queen , who reveals that Morty is the one responsible for their creation to a disgusted Rick.Sticky breaks the two free and together they defeat the sperm. While Rick and Morty starting planting nukes along the canyon walls, they discover that the remaining sperm are all heading for Las Vegas. While expected due to the city's history, Rick wonders why now. It is revealed that Summer has volunteered an egg, and the soldiers have planted it on top of the Luxor, planning to shoot it into space after all the sperm enter the egg. Morty radios the President and finally tells him the truth, which horrifies him and the nearby Smith family; not only because of Morty's lack of self-control which led to the \"Space Sperm\" but the realization that this will lead to the birth of an inbred biological child of Morty and Summer; in short, a \"Giant Incest Baby\". The President orders Shabooboo to jettison the egg into space before any sperm can get to it, but learns that it will take thirty minutes with no way to bypass the timer. Shabooboo commits suicide to avoid any consequences after given credit for Summer's idea, while Rick, Morty, and Sticky are captured by chuds. The Chud King plans to kill and eat the trio to punish Rick for having sex with his daughter, Princess Ponietta , but she intervenes after revealing she is pregnant with Rick's child . She convinces her father to send the chud armies to fight the sperm. In Las Vegas, the chuds and government fight the sperm to stop them from reaching the egg. The Sperm Queen almost crawls to the top of the Luxor, but is pushed to her death by Sticky. Unfortunately, to everyone's horror, he fertilizes the egg himself out of instinct. Summer attempts to destroy her egg, but the President intervenes, claiming that the baby now exists thanks to a heartbeat and it is election season. With no other option, they launch it into space.Morty is met by Kathy Ireland, approaches Morty to ask if Blazen was wearing her thong when he died. Expecting that he was told to keep it a secret, she encourages him to be honest, even if it hurts people the truth pertains to. Morty tells her the truth and she leaves in disgust. Rick decides to commit to Ponietta as she gives birth to a human/chud hybrid that looks like Rick, but leaves with it without trouble, and Rick takes out a Staples \"Easy\" button and presses it, causing it to say \"that was easy.\"In a post-credits scene, an astronaut talks to mission control as he does maintenance on a satellite, discussing how his wife had a child to try and keep him on Earth, but he left her behind regardless. As he talks about how the guilt of this has affected him, the \"Giant Incest Baby\" rises up in front of him in a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey and begins shaking him. During it, the president and  mission control complain about him and his drama."}, "45": {"title": "Amortycan Grickfitti", "text": " Beth asks Jerry to watch Morty and Summer due to an increased workload, but Rick stops her, shocking her by claiming he and Jerry are having a \"guy's night\" and have been for a while. She leaves the kids alone under threat to not cause any trouble, while Rick orders them not to touch any of his things. Morty plans to invite over Bruce Chutback , a new student at their school, and Summer agrees to help him impress Bruce in hopes of getting some in with him. \"Guy's night\" is revealed to be Rick letting Jerry hang out with demons who feed off of misery, paying back a debt he owes them for selling faulty skinhooks.Bruce arrives. Morty and Summer try to impress him with interdimensional cable and wine, but he is instead taken with Rick's car . The car's defense system comes online when they try to take it, but Summer and Morty convince it that Rick is in danger and they need to take it to go save him. They fly around the universe, showing Bruce different planets and smashing up anthropomorphic mailbox aliens called \"mailboxians\" with a baseball bat.Her work conflict resolved, Beth tracks Rick and Jerry to a karaoke bar and watches the demons enjoying Jerry's fumbling. Rick admits he is using Jerry to keep the demons satiated, but Beth confronts them regardless. Having heard good things about her from Rick and wanting to meet Jerry's wife, they invite her to drink \"Essence of Hell\" wine with them, and she accepts.Midway through their joyride, the car's system stops Bruce, Morty and Summer. It reveals that it has a recording of the entire night and plans to show Rick everything when he returns, using the time it has left to do whatever it wants and blame it all on the trio. The car uses a solar system as bait to catch and kill a gigantic god-like alien, then declares itself bored. It lets the kids get a meal before it takes them home and lets Rick punish them. Parking at a restaurant, it is dinged by a \"Changeformer,\" a robot that can turn back and forth between a car.

The car tries to get Summer and Morty to give Bruce to the authorities, but they refuse, so the car blows up the body it is inhabiting and escapes with the three through a hole in the wall, blowing up the police station that was holding them.Rick, Jerry and Beth kidnap a demon and restrain it to a wheelchair with a turret on top. Rick explains the turret shoots shrapnel that will convert the pleasure from pain back into pain, but needs Jerry's misery to power it. When Jerry refuses, Rick sincerely apologizes for misleading Jerry and admits that he does care about him, which ends up powering the turret. They use the turret to defeat the demons and portal out of Hell. Rick aggressively tells Jerry that guy's nights are over, which he takes in stride, to Rick's annoyance.Barely making it home in time, the kids collapse on the couch as the adults notice nothing suspicious.

In the past, Rick had turned himself into a turkey and gotten a pardon from The President, so The President has sent out multiple armored trucks, only one of which contains the presidential turkeys and will be guarded by marines. Rick plans to sneak aboard by turning himself into a turkey before they arrive, because the human eye cannot recognize a turkey's face, but The President has a solution: turning several marines into turkeys, all of which swallow capsules that identify them as humans in turkey form.Rick and Morty turn themselves into turkeys and distract the soldiers surrounding their house with robots. They land on top of the truck, knock out two turkey marines, and disguise themselves using the marines' headsets. The President, realizing Rick's deception, turns himself into a turkey, and enters the pen where turkeys wait to be selected for a pardon. He immediately recognizes Rick and the two fight.

When Morty apologizes to Rick for bringing him to the Citadel, a disgusted President Morty uses the brain scanning device to show Morty the full extent of the Citadel's Morty abuse - he reveals that Morties are so in demand that the Citadel started forcibly making Beths and Jerrys fall in love to produce Morties, then resorted to cloning - these Morties are then shipped to Ricks across the multiverse as sidekicks, and when a Morty dies, a new one is brainwashed with the old copy's memories and sent to replace them.Morty is horrified and loses faith in Rick, before he frees them from their bonds.

However, no matter how hard he tried, Rick could never find Prime, resulting in him killing dozens of Ricks across the multiverse in hopes of catching him, during which time he descended into depression and became an alcoholic to cope.

As Rick, Morty, and Summer uncomfortably listen from the dining room table, Jerry and the two Beths have an increasingly sexual conversation that culminates in all three of them hooking up. Rick is forced to calm Morty and Summer down as they finally break down over the situation.Space Beth bids the family goodbye while promising to keep an eye out for her space grandson . Rick quickly gets rid of the Venusian wine that apparently caused the two Beths to fall for each other.During a post-credits scene, Jerry visits the Jerryboree in an apparent attempt to pull the same love affair with himself that Beth did. He is not permitted to by the receptionist, due to the Jerryboree having an issue with this in the past, but he runs into a stray Jerry on the streets with a similar desire. The two share a quick kiss before deciding their curiosity is satisfied and quickly part ways."}, "54": {"title": "Night Family", "text": " Beth has trouble falling asleep due to Jerry 's snoring, and tries to sleep on the couch. However, she is startled by Rick , who is doing crunches on the floor in the living room. Rick then leaves the room without saying a thing. At breakfast, Rick explains to Beth that what she saw was his \"night person.\" Rick had purchased a machine called a \" Somnambulator \" from the Goobie-Joob System, which allows him to program his unconscious body to do things while he sleeps that he doesn't have time to while awake. As a result, he now has washboard abs thanks to Night Rick working out so much. Naturally, the rest of the family want a piece of the action and request to have night versions of themselves. Rick initially refuses, but eventually gives in.At first, the family is quite pleased with their night selves doing their chores and boring routines, and training their bodies for the waking family to use. Beth learns how to play the trumpet, Summer learns Spanish, Morty joins Rick in his squats and gets his own impressive abs (with the two starting a podcast on the subject) while Jerry becomes pen pals with Night Jerry. However, one day, Jerry tells Rick that he had a request from Night Summer that the day family start rinsing their dishes after using them, so that they are easier to wash. Rick is enraged at this request, telling the rest of the family that he has no intention of doing that, because the whole point of having night people is to do the shit that the day people don't want to do. The next morning, the Smith family wakes up to find all their dishes have been broken by their night selves in defiance. Rick responds by calling in a favor from a devil-like alien on another planet to make unbreakable plates.That evening, the Night Family retaliates. Led by Night Summer, they strap Rick down and force him to eat the leftover residue on the plates, making him vomit. They also get rid of all the house's furnishings and hide the Somnambulator to prevent Rick from destroying it (as that would destroy the Night Family). Taking this as a declaration of war, Rick creates a suit to keep Summer awake and has her go undercover that evening to find the Somnambulator and destroy it. Unfortunately, this fails, as Night Summer takes control just before Summer can do this. Night Rick cuts Day Rick off from all his technology and builds robots to enslave the Day Family.After days of working as slaves, the family is able to escape with the help of Night Jerry (through his friendship with Day Jerry) and try to escape the range of the Somnambulator; however, each time one of them is knocked out or tranquilized by the robots, their night versions take over, leaving the others to try and wake them up. This leads to a car chase as each member of the family is knocked out and awakened several times, adding more chaos and confusion to the situation. Eventually, Night Summer offers Day Rick a truce; they'll let the Day Family go if they promise to rinse their dishes. Day Rick still refuses, so the Night Family takes complete control.Months later, after going on several expensive vacations and living lives of luxury, the Night Family are completely destitute, realizing that the Day Family were the ones who properly handled the finances. Deciding that being in control isn't worth it anymore, the Night Family destroy the Somnambulator themselves and release the Smith family. Everyone wakes up disoriented, and Rick checks to see what has been going on and discovers the terrible news that the Choco Taco has been discontinued, to everyone's devastation."}, "55": {"title": "Final DeSmithation", "text": "The Smith family are dining at Panda Express, and discuss the next day's trip to the zoo. Jerry complains about the place giving him diarrhea, although the others point out that it wouldn't have happened if he hadn't eaten the food meant for the animals. When the meals over, the family are given their fortune cookies, with Summer pointing out they only comes true when the cookie is eaten first. Although the rest of the family is given generic meaningless ones, Jerry's fortune reads\"You will have sex with your mother\",much to everyone's shock and his dismay.Jerry starts getting paranoid that the fortune might come true, despite the fact he obviously would never have sex with his mother. Beth implores him to ignore it, while Morty and Summer find it hilarious and begin to poke fun at him with it. Jerry's nerves get worse when his mother starts calling him more since he's trying to ignore her and begs Rick to investigate or use science to make it impossible. Rick refuses stating that using science to make something impossible usually ends up making it more possible.Jerry tries taping up his genitals while Morty and Summer continues to play various pranks on Jerry (including hiding a stuffed doll made to look like Jerry's mom in his wardrobe which falls on him repeatedly making it look like it's performing fellatio). Jerry becomes so paranoid that he even starts dressing like Morty, since Morty's mom is Beth. Space Beth arrives to pick the family up for the zoo trip, but Rick asks Jerry to stay behind as he's been getting strange readings from Jerry's probability field regarding the fortune. The rest of the family leave, and Rick admits that he made that up the strange readings to get Jerry out of going to the zoo, and admits that as much as he dislikes Jerry he has the right to take this seriously. Turning on his device, Rick is startled to find that Jerry's fortune is registering and decides to run a test by getting two boxes with holes, writing Jerry's mom's name in one and asking him to choose one hole he would stick his penis in. Rick repeats the test several times, sometimes switching the boxes and is worried when Jerry keeps picking the mom box. Rick decides to do something he would never willingly choose to do... go to Panda Express. He reasons that someone is trying to get his attention (mentioning that all the restaurant had to do was get a liquor licence).Arriving with Jerry and announcing his presence to the backroom staff, he finds himself in a shootout which he is easily able to handle killing most of the employees. However he finds that the Panda Express staff are actually running a meth ring (which obviously Rick doesn't mind due to his aversion to the concept of laws) and have nothing to do with the fortune cookies which they get from the usual distributor. Apologizing to the two remaining staff for murdering their colleagues (which they accept, saying it's part of the risk), Rick agrees to not turn them in to the cops in exchange for the truck that delivers the fortune cookies.Taking the truck to the factory where the fortunes are made, they find them coming from a building which is way too extravagant for a company that makes something that's given away for free. Entering and dodging the retinal scans, they find hundreds of similar trucks and cameras everywhere. Rick changes his clothes to blend in by calling on the Eye of Thundera, then makes Jerry look like an assistant with a transformation sequence lifted from Sailor Moon.While infiltrating the factory, the pair quickly realize the company is controlling fate for profit. Jerry wants Rick to blow up the factory, but Rick would rather take over the factory instead. Soon after, they run into two security guards, who use emergency fortune cookies to beat Rick in a fight. With no other choice, Rick jumps into an air vent to escape, using Jerry as a human shield. Jerry survived and is taken inside the vent as well. The CEO of the factory, Jennith Padrow-Chunt, sees photos of Jerry and detects an unresolved fortune, and tells the guards to get Jerry's mother to the factory.While crawling through the air vent, Jerry expresses annoyance at Rick for using him as a human shield. Rick explains that since Jerry has an unresolved fortune, he literally cannot die until his fortune is fulfilled (in this case, until he has sex with his mother). The two eventually find their way into the room where the fortune cookies are being produced. At the center of the room is a huge alien strapped to the ceiling being fed glowing capsules and pooping out fortune cookies, while an old man puts fortunes inside of the cookies. Rick explains to Jerry that the alien is a Lockerean and that its species feeds off chaos. This particular Lockerean has a digestive issue that makes it strip randomness away from space-time, leaving behind super-dense pockets of energy in the form of fortune cookies that bend entropy towards definable outcomes. The old man introduces himself as Old Man Hucksbee, who explains Fortune 500's plan: to increase the value of real fortunes by mass-producing many worthless ones. Old Man Hucksbee has also apparently romanced the Lockerean and wants to escape the factory with it, so he put weird fortunes (including Jerry's) in the cookies in hopes that someone would investigate the factory, find them, and break them free. At that moment, Jennith Padrow-Chunt arrive with Jerry's mother as well as many armed security guards.Jennith, knowing that Jerry is immortal until he has sex with his mother, pushes Mrs. Smith toward him, trying to get them to have sex. Jerry runs away while Rick fights the soldiers, who all have special powers due to all of them ingesting fighting fortunes. He uses their fortunes against them before jumping into a few boxes of fortune cookies to ingest some random ones, hoping to find something good. The first batch don't really have any notable effects due to having the mass-produced worthless fortunes, but Rick finds a box of \"blanks\", cookies without fortunes that make the effects-upon-consumption completely unpredictable. He settles on force-feeding the soldiers blank fortunes in order to combat them with randomness. Rick eventually realizes Jennith is immortal until her fortune comes true, which is that she will become the most successful businesswoman ever. He fulfils this fortune by hacking the Goldman Sachs finance company, stealing trillions of dollars and purchasing everything Jennith's company offers, before emptying all her accounts and sending the money back to Goldman Sachs. Enraged, Jennith swallows many fortune cookies and becomes a blob-like monster. Rick frees the Lockerean, who swallows Jennith and Old Man Hucksbee.Unfortunately, the chaos is still not over yet, because while running away from his mother, Jerry trips over a chaos capsule and it turns into a black hole. Rick grabs the Lockerean, preventing it from being sucked in. However, he sees Jerry's mother getting her foot caught while being sucked toward the black hole. Jerry's pants also get sucked off and he is now getting sucked straight towards her, so Rick lets go of the Lockerean to grab a blank fortune and use a cybernetic implant to print \"Jerry no sex mom\" on it. At the last second, he swoops in and launches the fortune into Jerry's mouth, causing the black hole to disappear before their genitals make contact.When Rick and Jerry arrive home, Jerry gives Rick the last real fortune cookie with a handwritten note that says \"Thank you\", Rick makes which lightly chastises him for wasting but appreciates the sentiment of. Jerry thanks Rick and refers to him as a friend, which greatly angers Rick, who earlier had eaten a fortune cookie with a fortune saying \"You will make a new friend\" from the batch of mass-produce cookies. By referring to Rick as a friend, Jerry accidentally destroyed Rick's immortality. Jerry tries to play off their friendship as a fate they can still control, but this causes Rick to slap him in the face, causing him to cry. After Rick apologizes, Jerry forgives him, and the two head inside.In a post-credits scene, Morty, Summer, Beth, and Space Beth are in the zoo's gift shop. Morty is watching an ad for the zoo that was targeted to zebras. The humans in the zoo started eating the zebra food, leaving the zebras to starve, and then fighting and killing each other over it. Morty starts off confused about the purpose of the ad and why there was zebra food in the gift shop, before deducing that they were the ones in the zoo and that it was a human zoo."}, "56": {"title": "JuRicksic Mort", "text": "Morty is about to be late for school and asks Rick to help him arrive on time. Rick tries using his portal gun, which he is working on fixing. However, the portal gun is still somewhat unusable, because all it does is summon a Cthulhu -like beast. Rick drives it off and decides to simply drive Morty to school. On the way, Morty brings up the portal gun and Rick tells him that every time someone brings up the portal gun, it demotivates him to fix it and that this is his \"process\".When Morty arrives at school, mysterious giant spaceships land everywhere on Earth. The spaceships contain dinosaurs, who are shocked to find out that dinosaurs went extinct on Earth and that evolved monkeys now rule the planet. When those dinosaurs left Earth, the world was a utopia where technology was only used for the good of all living creatures. Their technology was so advanced that they decided to travel to distant corners of the galaxy, helping other planets to achieve the same level of peace. However, upon their return, they see humanity didn't use their technology for building a utopia, so they decide to take matters into their own hands again. At a UN meeting, the three leaders of the dinosaurs\u2014a Tyrannosaurus, a Brachiosaurus, and a Triceratops\u2014convince the planet's leaders to take a vacation and enjoy life while they change the world for the better. The dinosaurs end world hunger, remove the necessity for jobs, and solve all of humanity's other problems.Everyone is now free to enjoy their lives, and Morty, Summer, and Beth eventually get very bored from having nothing to do anymore. Jerry finally manages to publish his book, titled \" Never Trying Never Fails \". The President phone-calls Rick, who meets him at a restaurant called \"Bar-Beau-Q\". The President is tired of doing nothing all day and asks Rick to get rid of the dinosaurs, however, the dinosaurs' presence don't affect Rick since he's used to living responsibility-free. The President makes a deal with Rick: if he gets rid of the dinosaurs, Rick can host the 95th Annual Academy Awards. Rick accepts.Rick and Morty meet the dinosaurs' three leaders. Rick introduces himself as the most powerful human being alive, and tells the dinosaurs he is willing to share the secrets of interdimensional travel so that they can spread their culture across other universes. The dinosaurs respond by saying they discovered interdimensional travel years ago and that they have a strict \"one-universe\" policy. They also tell Rick that his portal travel method is sub-optimal, give him an improved portal pistol, and even volunteer to close the interdimensional rift that Evil Morty left behind. After sending Rick and Morty back to their house, Rick gets enraged, destroys the portal pistol, and decides to travel to some of the planets that the dinosaurs have previously travelled to.While going with Morty to other planets, Rick finds out that every planet that used to contain dinosaurs was wiped out by giant meteors, and now each planet has different species with their own explanations of the craters and the dinosaur fossils\u2014from dinosaurs using the craters as amphitheaters to using them as skate parks. As it turns out, the evolution of the dinosaurs into morally perfect creatures led the universe to seek balance by devolving some creatures that wreak havoc across the galaxy, and those creatures were sentient meteors who seek out their nemesis: the dinosaurs.Back on Earth, the dinosaurs turn Jerry's book into a manual for humanity to survive the lack of problems. Unfortunately for Jerry, he doesn't get credit because the dinosaurs believe the manual's author simply wants to spread the word and wasn't expecting credit. Rick and Morty arrive back on Earth and Rick reveals that there's a screaming meteor headed for them, causing the entire human population to revolt against the dinosaurs.After spending some time devising a solution to the meteor problem that doesn't require violence, the dinosaurs decide to leave Earth for its own good. The planet reverts back to its old state, with war, crime, hunger, pollution, and the destruction of natural resources. People are content, though, as having so many troubles distract them from the emptiness of existence. Rick celebrates his victory during the 95th Annual Academy Awards. Still, when he learns backstage that the dinosaurs are on Mars, ready to sacrifice themselves to the meteors, he leaves in a hurry.Rick travels to Mars and claims he will wait for the killer meteor with the dinosaurs, risking his life out of pettiness. The meteor is rapidly approaching and the dinosaurs attempt to teleport Rick away, but he dino-proofed himself so that they can't do so. The dinosaurs are distressed by the thought of a meteor killing a human, so eventually one of the dinosaurs resorts to destroying the rock. To get Rick back, the dinosaurs close up the rift in the Central Finite Curve , and Rick yells in despair that the rift could have been used to be milked for a whole season, or \"like, a three-episode arc, at least\", making a subtle reference to Gravity Falls ' event Weirdmageddon .

Knowing the danger of letting Leon escape, Rick takes Morty through the meta layer into the Meta Reality.They manage to get to Leon but Leon summons Jesus Christ who in turn summons the Story Lord who managed to escape from the Story Train. Story Lord reveals that he has grown weary of just being someone the duo previously fought and plans to obtain motivation in order to be more than just a fictional character. While Jesus battles Rick and Morty, Story Lord openly betrays Jesus much to the latter's disbelief and is then ambushed by Previous Leon, who traps him in his recap venom. Rick then knocks out Leon, intending to take him to the Self-Referential Six. The two with Leon arrive at the groups' fortress where they clash with the members; Miss Lead (establishes expectations and subverts them), Flash Back (enters and observes past events), Connie TinuityError (warps reality making it inconsistent with the past), Protago Nick (makes any character a protagonist), and Mr. Twist (creates plot twists).

Dr. Wong hears Rick out and suggests he simply ignore them, giving him the assignment to prove her wrong with scientific evidence. Rick takes up the assignment, which the family initially commends until a new villain by the name of Pissmaster arrives at the Smith residence and starts bullying the family, including crude remarks towards Summer. Jerry, fed up with Rick's lack of action, confronts Pissmaster instead, beating the man into submission as their neighbors film the ordeal.Jerry is soon dubbed a hero for his actions, and is approached to join an intergalactic council of heroes, the centerpiece of which is a (sticky) orb of power. Unsure of what to do with the orb, Jerry recruits Rick's help, and the latter reluctantly builds an exo-suit that harnesses the orb's powers. Jerry quickly becomes an intergalactic hero with the suit, making Rick jealous. He confronts Dr. Wong, claiming her advice didn't work, but Dr. Wong points out that by not interfering with galactic affairs, Rick has gotten what he wanted: he is unburdened from needing to prove his power to other people, and thus he doesn't have to interfere with the rest of the galaxy.At first, Rick is relieved, but soon finds himself bored. Hearing that Pissmaster is now considered a laughing-stock of the universe, Rick finds himself sympathizing with his thwarted enemy and decides to reach out. However, upon arriving at Pissmaster's home Rick is horrified to learn he had committed suicide, with a note claiming it was because of Jerry. Rick resolves to redeem Pissmaster in the eyes of his family and the public by disguising himself as Pissmaster and committing various heroic deeds, planning to culminate in Pissmaster heroically sacrificing himself \u2013 to his surprise, an admittedly puzzled Dr. Wong voices that so long as this makes him happy it is worth doing.

Fed up with the two's behavior, the council retracts their offer and ejects Jerry from the council. Not wanting to reveal Pissmaster killed himself because of Jerry, Rick claims he was Pissmaster the whole time, which the family accepts despite the obvious inconsistencies. However, when they get home Rick panics and shows Morty the real Pissmaster's suicide note.

While waiting in line, Morty picks up the dropped sandwich of two armored knights and tries to return it to them, politely declining their offer for him to keep the sandwich since he prefers to stand in line. One of the knights, Sir Helios, offers Morty his sword and his title as a Knight of the Sun. Rick discourages Morty from taking it, but Morty gets pressured by the knights and various other aliens offering to take it instead to go ahead and take the sword. Sir Helios dubs Morty \"Sir Mortaniel\" and kills himself with the sword. Rick watches in bewilderment as Morty is abruptly transported with the other knight to the Sun, then questions why the other aliens are not simply eating the dropped food. One of the patrons reveals they are paid by the pop-up to stand there to drive up business, which Rick suspected.Morty arrives on the Sun to find it contains a medieval-like feudalist society living on a massive walkway, and agrees at the encouragement of the other knights and the King of the Sun to join them as an immortal being. That is, until he learns that a requirement of new knights is to cut off their penis. He promptly declares he is no longer interested, to the Knights' shock. Rick arrives to help Morty get out of his situation, but the King of the Sun demands Morty best him in combat if he wishes to leave. Rick gives Morty an AI Sword, which allows Morty to defeat the King easily. However, this backfires when the King relinquishes his crown and the Solar Scepter, declaring Morty is now King of the Sun before also killing himself. The Knights hail \"King Mortaniel\" but Rick and Morty promptly leave through a portal.Back in the garage, Morty expects Rick to rub his recent debacle in his face. To his surprise, Rick decides not to, claiming Morty ignoring him at the pop-up made him realize how low he let Morty's opinion of him get. He agrees to be 22% nicer to Morty for at least one adventure. Their moment is interrupted by the arrival of the Knights of the Sun, whose duty is to follow him all day. They continue to trail Morty even to the Smith Family breakfast. The Knights explain that they and the King are meant to protect the Solar Scepter, which all planets in the solar system orbit, which is why they keep it on the Sun. Morty promptly reveals this is not true by explaining the basic physics of the solar system to the knights and revealing he has had the scepter on Earth. The Knights, angered that they cut off their penises for nothing, march off in a huff. At first, it seems that Morty has successfully used science and logic to destroy a religion, which the whole family praises him for. However, their celebration is interrupted by the sky changing color and all their electricity malfunctioning. One of the Knights, who missed everything because he went to the bathroom, explains the Sons of the Moon are attacking the Sun, but should be held off by a series of interplanetary treaties so long as the Knights stay together. He awkwardly backs out of the house upon realizing what happened.Rick and Morty arrive at a neutral zone to find all the representatives from the various planets' rulers arguing over the sudden disappearance of the Knights of the Sun. Morty tries to interrupt through his authority as King of the Sun, but a magic hag reveals to the council that the Knights have disbanded. Lithdor, one of the Viscounts of Venus, questions Morty's legitimacy. Morty tries to prove it by revealing the Scepter, only to rather quickly learn that the Knights' claim that all planets orbit around it was symbolic: the Scepter actually denotes who rules the solar system, and all the rulers of the planets promptly start fighting for it while Rick and Morty make their escape.A bloody solar war breaks out across the solar system as Rick uses his technology to protect Earth. Morty suggests they try jumping universes again , but Rick proposes they actually commit to this universe and try something else. Morty finally explodes, accusing Rick of pulling another \" Vat of Acid \" to rub Morty being wrong in his face again. Rick reiterates that he is just trying to do better, leading Morty to suspect he is a robot or a clone. Rick brushes off this accusation, and encourages Morty to think of something. Morty tracks down the Knights of the Sun to try to get them to return to the Sun. The Knights, who have become addicted to heroin in their despair over their loss of purpose, refuse to return to the Sun. Morty offers to cut his penis off if they do, which they point out would be pointless as he no longer needs to do it as king: Morty promises to do it anyway, which convinces them. Privately, of course, Morty is distraught, so Rick pulls him aside and promises to help him not have to actually cut it off using multiple fail-safes.The Knights of the Sun reunite, prompting most of the planets to declare an end to the war. However, Lithdor suspects trickery and comes to the walkway to oversee the \"Stumping of the King's Stem.\" First, he has Morty step through a machine that scans for \"nanotechnological hologram dicks\". Rick accounted for this, and Morty steps through with ease. But Lithdor then has Morty step through a second machine that checks for \"emergency clone dicks.\" Morty quickly throws his away before stepping through the machine and passes once again. The third test, the old hag from before, reveals the presence of a \"prosthetic/witchcraft dick\", which he once again throws away.

This prompted the knights to finally do away with their \"stem stumping.\" It is revealed Rick and Morty snuck back to the walkway to learn what happened while they were gone, despite Morty pointing out they are risking ruining their whole escape by coming back. One of the pages walks by and realizes Morty is alive, but is easily convinced not to tell anyone when Morty points out the only thing that will come of revealing his survival is the page having to cut off his penis.In the post credit scene, Special Agent Mongo Bongo arrests the Hot Dog Vendor at the Restaurant Asteroid for illegal hot dog trafficking.

The doors open upon a secret lab where they encounter a disheveled and unkempt looking Rick. Morty learns that the Rick accompanying him, the one who has been uncharacteristically nice to him and his family for the last few months, is in fact a robot. Morty becomes enraged. Rick explains that he took himself out of the family after the Knights of the Sun episode in order to dedicate himself to the pursuit of Rick Prime . Rick admits that he is ashamed of his inability to move past his vendetta and that he built a robot, RickBot, to hide himself.

Despite the betrayal, and forgetting about the lightsaber, Morty decides to keep RickBot a secret and leaves the real Rick alone in his lab.Morty and Rickbot return to the living room to watch an extended version of Miracle on 34th Street with the rest of the family. Suddenly, the presidential chopper lands on the lawn and the President arrives to berate Morty for dropping his lightsaber into the ground. The President informs Morty that the lightsaber is heading straight for the planet's core and that, because the lightsaber is powered by Kyber Crystals, it's impact with the core will destroy the Earth. Morty tearfully apologizes and calls this the worst Christmas ever. The President reassures Morty that together they will be able to recover the saber and save Earth.Morty leads the President down into Rick's Lair where a portal is set up, allowing a team scientists and military personnel to congregate for a Presidential briefing. The President informs his crew about the impending catastrophe. Rick interrupts the briefing and orders everyone to leave, claiming that he will take care of destroying the lightsaber. Morty and the President insist on taking care of it, arguing that the saber should be saved and returned to Morty. Shortly thereafter, the President realizes that, due to the blatant incompetence of his team, his plan of using a drill ship to recover the saber will undoubtedly fail. He thus caves and asks Rick for help. Rick agrees and orders an AI-powered lightsaber of his own making to target and destroy Morty's falling lightsaber. Unfortunately, annoyed by Rick's constant requests for status updates, the AI-powered lighsaber defects, diverts from its course and winds up in Italy, chaotically murdering several people.Meanwhile, in the living room, the rest of the family, including Rickbot, having grown tired of the inanity of the extended version of Jerry's favorite movie, decide to play a Christmas game. Ostensibly troubled by his predicament of being required to both love and respect the family while at the same time having to lie to them about being a robot, Rickbot suggest they play a game which he hopes will enable them to discover that he is a robot. The family is none the wiser, and continues to voice their adoration for Rick's new and positive attitude.Back in Rick's Lair, Rick finishes modifying the science team's drill ship to make it fast enough to reach the falling saber in time to avoid Earth's annihilation. Morty rejects Rick's offer to accompany him on the voyage and makes it clear that he does not want Rick around anymore, insisting on the seriousness of Rick's betrayal. Rick launches into a diatribe, admitting that part of the reason he replaced himself with Rickbot was because Morty dismissed him as boring and insignificant just before joining the Knights of the Sun. Rick himself felt betrayed and admits that he regrets ever letting anyone into his personal life. Rick storms off. Then, Morty and the President man the drill ship and start drilling towards the falling lightsaber. The team manages to recover the lightsaber and returns to the surface to celebrate. However, the President takes the lightsaber away from Morty, declaring that he is entitled to it due to having been raised and ultimately betrayed by the Star Wars franchise. Morty is fuming, feeling once again betrayed by a trusted mentor.Back in Smith's dining room, Jerry invites RickBot to cut the Christmas ham. An angry Morty enters from the garage and reveals to all that their Rick is a robot. Furious, the entire family proceeds to decapitate and dismember RickBot. Rickbot serenely welcomes death, finally relieved of a life of deceiving the ones he loves.Meanwhile, the President returns to the Oval Office with his newly acquired lightsaber and, just like Morty before him, swings it wildly and accidentally throws it away, the saber ultimately landing perfectly vertical into the Office's floor and slipping out of sight.Now in the living room, the Smith's top their Christmas tree with Rickbot's decapitated head. An emergency presidential address appears on their TV in which the President warns the nation that Morty Smith has dropped a lightsaber that is rapidly falling towards the Earth's core and that will ultimately cause Earth to explode. The President then accidentally reveals that he is safely sheltered in a spacestation orbiting Earth. Having no other recourse to save the world, the Smiths reactivate Rickbot's head.In his lab, the real Rick dismantles one of Rick Prime's killbot drones and uses it to uncover Rick Prime's location. Unexpectedly, his computer reveals that Rick Prime is located in multiple locations.In the space station, the President learns that a hastily reassembled Rickbot successfully saved Earth from Morty's falling saber. Suddenly, a lightsaber blade cuts through the office door, creating a hole from which Rickbot and Morty emerge. The revengeful duo chase the President into a Star Wars-themed room. They fend off the small contingent of droids set upon them and overtake a Gatling saber-gun wielding President. Morty acquires the saber-gun and fires upon the President. Rickbot, disguising his deliberate suicide attempt as a heroic sacrifice, jumps in front of the President and absorbs the five saber-bullets into his chest, saving the President. The saber-bullets fall through Rickbot's chest and land perfectly vertical in the space station floor, blowing a hole through it. The vacuum of space sucks Morty, the President, and a slowly dying RickBot through the floor, and just as they are about to be ejected into space, a portal appears in their way. They fall through and land next to a disgruntled Rick in his garage on Earth. Rickbot dies telling Morty that Rick created him because he cares about his family.After the President sees himself out, a remorseful Rick invites Morty into his lab and shares his progress in his quest to find Rick Prime. Rick has discovered that Rick Prime is located simultaneously at hundreds of different locations in the multiverse. He tells Morty that next season will be dedicated to his most painful adventure yet, namely the obsessive search for his crafty nemesis.In the tag, an alarmingly muscular Mr. Poopybutthole finishes watching the episode in a fitness studio and tells the audience that he is trying to rebound from his divorce through weightlifting.

When Rick offers only a gun to help, Jerry insults Rick claiming that his naturally superior intellect is completely wasted on his reprehensible personality. Taking offense at the idea that he was simply born smart, and the implication that effort and dedication played no part in his achievements, Rick decides they should swap minds-that is, to insert Rick's mind into Jerry's brain, and Jerry's mind into Rick's brain-so that they can find out together the true meaning of waste. Upon swapping minds, Rick, in Jerry's body, has a nervous breakdown and blows his brains out onto the garage shelf and walls.

After detecting the emergency, the garage's AI system begins the reassemble and revive them.On some alien asteroid, Morty is getting kidnapped by low-level thugs in the employment of galactic mobster Chuxly . When the latter realizes that his men are responsible for detaining Morty Smith, known sidekick of the mercilessly dangerous Rick Sanchez, Chuxly, fearful of the wrath this transgression could incur, bends over backwards to make Morty feel comfortable.Back in the garage, Rick and Jerry are reassembled and revived, and find out that they now share significant portions of each other's brain and that their personalities have merged; they each think that they are Rick and that the other is Jerry, and bicker about who will be the one to fix the issue. Jerry Rick receives a phone call from an anxious Chuxly who attempts to explain the misunderstanding surrounding Morty's kidnapping. After a cringy and confusing exchange between Chuxly and the merged personas, both Rick Jerry and Jerry Rick menacingly tell Chuxly that they are on their way.Still bickering, the mixed up Rick and Jerry crash chaotically into Chuxly's clubhouse and make disorganized threats to the Mobster. Sensing a lack of coherence and a weakness in the mixed-up pair, the gangsters seize the opportunity and attack. The threat of a common enemy and their shared care for Morty empower the duo to cooperate. They fight back, take out the thugs, and ultimately run Rick's modified conehead through Chuxly's torso, all the while kindling a friendship over their shared passion for creatively destroying opponents. When they return home with Morty, Beth discovers the state of her father and husband, and grows worried about the duo being too comfortable in their mixed up state and of their new found friendship. She goes to bed as Rick Jerry and Jerry Rick assemble the equipment required to reorganize their persons. The next day, however, Beth wakes up to find a note suggesting that Rick Jerry and Jerry Rick have left the family.In the near future, Rick Jerry and Jerry Rick, under the pseudonyms Burger and Fries, have become a rowdy and unstoppable crime team, leaving death, destruction, and burgers in their wake. The rest of the Smith family, hoping to catch up with the duo and convince them to return home, follow the trails of criminal activity. Unfortunately, their search leads them into a trap set by a vengeful (and still alive) Chuxly. The family is taken hostage.

Jerricky sets the family free and, all together, they fight and murder the mobsters and his minions. They then return home.Back at home, the family convenes in the garage where Jerricky announces that he will be leaving; the fused being feels no attachment to the family of his constitutive personas, claiming that he only needs to love himself. Their neighbor Gene enters the garage to return the rake that he had all along. Uninterested, Jerricky throws the rake to the floor. Upon turning to leave, Jerricky accidentally steps on the head of the rake, causing the handle swing up and hit the being in both of its heads. This causes the personas of Rick and Jerry to unmerge. Rick reveals that the individual personas are still intact but trapped inside Jerricky and, indeed, that they were saved and preserved by memory Rick . Rick implores Morty to find a way to unfuse his merged body.At the dinner table a little later, everything is back to normal, Rick and Jerry each seated in their usual seats at the table.

Once there, Curtis tells him that he's heard reports of a rise of a cult in Virginia and need Rick's help to investigate. However he sees that Dr. Wong has also been brought along raising Rick's suspicions of Curtis and Wong dating.Turns out, Virginia is not a sex cult but instead Unity (Rick's ex-lover) has taken over the state of Virginia despite Rick claiming to have agreed with Unity that she would not take over Earth. Rick begins to un-assimilate the people of Virginia by spraying them with \"Seperation\" a scent he picked up after breaking it off with Unity.As Rick is taking back Virginia, he finds out that Andre (Mr. President) and Helen (Dr. Wong) are now on a first name basis.Unity tries to explain to Rick that she is here because she is worried for Rick after hearing he is going after Rick Prime yet again. She mentions that she left many voicemails in attempt to contact him.After escaping Virginia, Rick and Andre secure Virginia in an \"energy dome\" so Unity cannot control Virginia. Though, existance of the dome brings down the president's approval ratings.

Unfortunately, as tends to be the case with situations involving Rick, there is a twist: Morty learns that the spaghetti comes from dead bodies. Specifically, bodies from a planet where people who kill themselves turn into spaghetti \u2013 more specifically, the best spaghetti in the universe. Morty finds the whole situation morally reprehensible and immediately confesses to the situation at a funeral for one of the people they ate, against Rick's protests. He also tells his family, though he is annoyed when they are more disappointed at the loss of their spaghetti nights than the fact they were eating people. The president of Spaghetti Planet contacts Morty after hearing about the funeral confession and offers Morty some \"ethically-sourced\" spaghetti, from a sickly person who sought assisted suicide and accepted their fate as food. Morty finds the idea that he is eating someone who wanted to become food more palatable, and he and the family return to their old spaghetti nights.Rick getting \"spaghetti.\"However, Rick reveals the planet turned making spaghetti into a full industry, selling cans of \"MortyO's Suicide Spaghetti\" across the galaxy. Morty proposes this is still ethical upon noticing the cans have messages from the people the spaghetti came from, until Rick brings him back to Spaghetti Planet and reveals the government have resorted to encouraging depression in the people in order to keep up with the demand. The president of Spaghetti Planet protests that they need to keep the spaghetti trade open or else it will destroy the global economy, which could prove much more destructive. Morty reluctantly asks Rick for assistance to solve the issue, promising to do what Rick wants (for only two weeks). Rick's initial attempt to create sentient clones programmed to kill themselves fails when the clones resort to drastic measures to avoid becoming food; his further attempts at creating less-sentient beings also leave something to be desired, with his most promising result being a torso that is physically unable to do anything, much less kill itself. They eventually solve the problem when Morty suggests giving it a functioning arm. At first, spaghetti production returns with these torsos, only for everyone to find some fault in this: a group of alien consumers claim it tastes terrible and demand real spaghetti, and a group of planet inhabitants still claim it is unethical and claim torso rights (and both end up suicide-bombing the factory due to arguing over which should go first).Chaos soon erupts on the Spaghetti Planet as other aliens arrive demanding more spaghetti and try to force people to kill themselves. Rick offers one last alternative: take the last person on the planet who is willing to kill themselves and genetically clone the spaghetti so people can still get their fix. The person in question, a man by the name of Fred Bunks who only has two months to live, has put off killing himself out of his own moral opposition to the spaghetti trade. However, Rick informs Fred that if he helps them, his death will end the spaghetti industry on the planet for good. He takes Fred to an assisted-suicide device, which will show Fred and the entire planet his entire life and memories before he chooses to kill himself. Fred's life is then shown to the entire planet, with all his both immoral and moral actions and the complexities that led to him ultimately living a fulfilling life.As expected, Fred's insides turn into spaghetti after he dies. However, having witnessed the entirety of Fred's life in all its nuances,no onewants to eat him or the spaghetti anymore. Rick explains to Morty it was never about it being right or wrong to eat dead people, but whether you can stomach it while knowing the complexities of the life they lived \u2013 and indeed, the claimed-nihilist Rick loses his appetite for the spaghetti from having seen Fred's life. The Smith Family dinner is replaced with salisbury steak, which Rick promises he procured from another ethically dubious source, but the Smith Family chooses to live in ignorance since the steak is so good.In the Post Credit scene, a planet filled with sentient vacuum cleaners receives a planet-wide broadcast similar to Rick's back on the Spaghetti planet.

Cutting to the present, Evil Morty dodges various creatures in a strange dimension as he gathers resources, until finally retiring to the safety of his personal inter-dimensional oasis. His peaceful relaxation is quickly interrupted when the protective barrier surrounding his haven starts failing and alien creatures start invading. He learns that the disruption is originating from an impressive space-station in an undisclosed location.In the space-station, Rick and Morty are working together to track down Rick Prime . They are teleporting each suspected Rick into human-sized test tubes to be murdered. Each Rick turns out to be a decoy. Evil Morty enters their lab through a portal and complains that their \"fracking\" of the Central Finite Curve is messing with his peace. He suggests to Rick that it would speed up progress to adjust the scanner ray to filter for probability stasis. This seems to bring in a different kind of Rick Prime, but Rick suspects a trap while Evil Morty suggests Rick is just disappointed that he needed someone else's help, and Evil Morty at that. Morty gets tired of their argument and tries to kill the Rick Prime they caught, but instead activates a black portal fluid trap that brings them into a prison for Ricks who also tried to track down Rick Prime.A video image of Rick Prime appears, and explains after he personally killed all of the Ricks' Dianes , he also killed Diane in every universe across infinity using a \"weapon too cool for a name\" ( but is \"known to inferiors as the Omega Device \"). He offers to let one of the Ricks have their Diane back by killing each other in a tournament-style battle royale. Despite Rick's warning that Rick Prime is lying, the other Ricks proceed to kill each other, with Rick and Evil Morty teaming up in the end to kill the last Rick. As predicted, Rick Prime's promise was a lie and a bomb imbued with Diane's face and personality is dropped into the room, which Rick and Evil Morty destroy before combining their knowledge and resources to get them and Morty out of the prison and into Rick's basement laboratory. Using the remaining fluid from the portal trap, Rick finally manages to track down Rick Prime's location for real. Evil Morty elects to stick around, knowing the existence of the Omega Device threatens him as well, but Rick decides to kill Rick Prime by himself and finally get revenge. Evil Morty warns Morty that just letting Rick kill Rick Prime will not end well for him emotionally, which convinces Morty to join Evil Morty in following Rick.Rick arrives at Rick Prime's lair, fighting off various drones along the way. Entering the main chamber that houses the Omega Device, he is angered to realize Morty and Evil Morty followed him. Rick Prime appears, impressed that \"dead-wife Rick\" tracked him down. He calls out Rick for using Diane's voice for his Space Cruiser AI, and threatens to use the Omega Device on Rick and his family. He starts by killing Slow Mobius , or \"Uncle Slow\", to Rick's horror and Morty's confusion (the latter having not known they were related). A vicious, brutal fight ensues, with Rick, Morty, and Evil Morty combining forces to stop Rick Prime. Eventually, with Morty and Rick knocked out from the fight, Evil Morty is able to incapacitate Rick Prime by swapping outfits with Morty and faking a reunion with Rick Prime's \"original grandson.\" Dragging Rick Prime into another room, Evil Morty restrains him and scans his mind. He preemptively erases Prime's backup clones to prevent him from coming back, before finding and downloading the schematics for the Omega Device. He then drags in Rick's body and revives him, offering him free rein to get his revenge. Rick Prime warns Rick that he should stop Evil Morty while he has the chance, but Rick begins punching him. His healing field having been deactivated in the fight, Rick Prime defiantly taunts Rick for having become just like him in the end as he is slowly beaten to death.Evil Morty disables the Omega Device just as Rick emerges, covered in Rick Prime's blood. Evil Morty observes that Rick appears unsatisfied at having gotten revenge, before reminding Rick he has the means to recreate the Omega Device if he so chooses. But he won't, at least for now, as he points out that such a weapon would only bring him the same problems it brought Rick Prime (such as \"vengeful Summer s\"), whereas he just wants to be left alone. Begrudgingly, though, he admits that there is something a little different about Rick than all the others he's seen. He notes he may find Rick useful one day as he leaves, though he again reminds Rick and Morty not to follow him.Morty and Rick return home, with Morty celebrating the defeat of Rick Prime. Rick, on the other hand, is left disillusioned at having lost his purpose after finally succeeding in his life-long revenge quest.

A rock-like being known as the Observer arrives and begins cuing up \"clips\" based on Morty's notes of the adventures, finding ones that count as adventures, and ones that Rick claims don't: either because the adventure was aborted, he wasn't there, or Morty was just lying. Eventually, though, the Observer starts stirring conflict by showing clips from adventures that were not even requested, and offers to show them a montage of clips of them being rude to each other. Realizing the Observer is just trying to cause trouble, Rick and Morty step aside and agree to cash in some of the cards at a lower rate to stop the Observer from annoying them.However, the Observer \"observed\" this conversation, and develops a grudge against Rick and Morty. He stands in front of their house and keeps showing more embarrassing clips: when Summer , Beth , and Space Beth show up and complain about it, it starts showing clips of them, too, to their annoyance. Only Jerry is unfazed, since he already knows he is embarrassing. Finally fed up, Morty goes outside to beat up the Observer: he ends up shoving it out into the street where it gets run over by a truck, breaking it into pieces and killing it. Rick suggests they get out of the street and pretend it never happened, only to wonder if it will get used as a clip to be played in front of a jury of more Observers ... which is precisely what happens.Put on trial by the Observers for killing one of their kind, the situation looks grim for Rick and Morty, until Rick points out they already did a trial of this kind : a court-appointed Observer defender proves this by showing their time in Giant Court . The Observers start showing more clips of Rick and Morty's misdeeds: Rick giving Morty guns but never being clear on what they do, only for Morty to find out in embarrassing circumstances; experimenting with burying both people and inanimate objects in Pet Sematary; Morty asking Rick to give life to his churro, leading Rick to create Churry , only for Morty to abandon Churry on another planet upon learning he is immortal\u2013leading Churry to swear vengeance; and the time Rick killed \"the versions of us that were inSpace Jam\".Annoyed with the progress of the court, Rick tricks the Observers into giving him control of their technology by pretending to show a clip in his defense, allowing him to stop their execution.

Morty, who is also attending the party, asks for one too as he has wanted one for ages but Rick refuses. At the party, Summer impresses the other partygoers with her increased dexterity and strength, and adjusting her charisma to flirt with Jimmy. Morty grows fed up and steals the attribute slider from Summer, briefly using it to give her increased intelligence that gives her a literally enlarged brain while he uses it to buff his body to impress Tricia Lange . However, Summer holds her own by using her intelligence to create a Rube Goldberg-like chain of events that cause Morty to trip and embarrass himself. The two fight until they fall into the pool with the device. The result is Summer and Morty becoming a kuato (fromTotal Recall): the two enfuse with Morty becoming a small being protruding from Summer's stomach who can only repeat the phrase, \"Open your mind.\"Rick refuses to help Summer until the next day when she can fulfill the chore wheel. However, Summer gets a targeted ad about a club called Mind Openerz where she can party with other kuatos. There she meets another kuato named Kwyatt, who invites her to party led by a kuato named Kenneth. She parties with the rest of the kuatos before ostensibly leaving with Kwyatt. However, just as she is ready to have a moment, he reveals himself to be a lure as she is abruptly kidnapped and sedated. She wakes up being loaded into an incinerator, with Morty having been removed from her stomach. She uses her robotic ponytail (a device Rick installed) to free herself and kills the mortician before he can try to kill another former kuato, a woman she met at the bar.Summer tracks down Kwyatt and beats him up for Morty's location: Kwyatt reveals Morty is going to be auctioned off to the highest bidder, part of a trafficking scheme by Kenneth. She forces Kwyatt to take her to Kenneth. Meanwhile Rick notices that Summer has neglected her chores and chases her down to Mind Openerz, beating up various others for information, though he has to apologize to a few after it turns out most of them were low money-making bystanders who just happened to briefly meet Summer.

Rick tricks two of the guards into running away by feigning his own psychic powers before he and Summer search for Morty throughout the complex. They track him down to a boat, only to have to fight off all of Kenneth's guards.During the fight, Summer complains that the only reason they are in this mess is because Rick would not unmerge them when asked, complaining that Rick lets Morty do everything for free. Rick reveals in annoyance that Morty is basically a dog who follows him around for free, whereas Rick sees Summer more as a cat as he respects her as an equal since she reminds him of her grandmother . They finish off the guards while Kuato Morty holds his own by sedating Kenneth's scientist. Summer and Rick confront Kenneth, whose kuato abruptly jumps out of him, killing Kenneth in the process, into a robotic spider legs device. Rick is unimpressed, even when another kuato emerges from the same kuato's stomach and reveals himself as the mastermind. Kuato Morty arrives and promptly starts beating up the kuato's kuato, who then starts fighting him with a kuato knife and missiles from his spider device. The kuato's kuato then reveals another kuato, and is about to reveal another one before Rick finally grows fed-up with the gimmick. He promptly takes control of the device, sending the kuato (and the device with it) tumbling into the water to drown. However, Morty admits to Summer he wanted the spider device, prompting Rick to try and bring it back with the kuato still in it. When it gets stuck halfway up the side of the boat, the constant shaking of the device briefly revives the kuato, though he unceremoniously gets dumped out, and Morty gets the spider device.Impressed by the device's capabilities, Summer has Kuato Morty join the school's Frolf Team. Impressed, Jimmy tries to flirt with Summer, but she politely turns him down, instead choosing to go out with the woman she saved from Kenneth. Jimmy is impressed at this revelation of Summer's \"complexity\", only to be interrupted by an off-screen explosion: Morty activated one of the missiles in the device and destroyed the stadium's bleachers.In the post credit scene, the buyer who wanted to buy Kuato Morty is relaxing in his lounge with his friends waiting for him to arrive unaware that the trade was interfered by Rick and Summer.

A rock then falls on Magma-Q, who before dying, gives Water-T a \"prophecy or some shit.\" Water-T summons two guns, and while Magnesium-J tries to talk Water-T out of it by saying there are too many Numbericons, Water-T responds by saying he better \"crunch the numbers.\" A title card shows displaying \"Water-T and the Rise of the Numbericons: The Movie.\" He is then seen killing several Numbericons, and poses enough of a threat to them to force them to retreat. After setting up a bracket shield that a Numbericon ship crashes into, he is picked up in the Glyph Jumper by Lithium-P.

Suddenly, Water-T, in his human form, appears to the two of them. Although Water-T claims that he doesn't remember who Morty is, despite the latter trying to remind him about their previous episode, he does remember Goldenfold as his former math teacher. The two are on frosty terms though, as Goldenfold resents Water-T for not giving him his homework after all these years. Still, Water-T asks Goldenfold to help him decipher the \"I\" of Harmony as the fate of Alphebetrium rests on the latter's knowledge of math. Suddenly, a squad of Numbericons attack the school, led by Sinstar-7, to kill Water-T. With no other options, Water-T takes Goldenfold back to Lithium-P's ship, with Goldenfold dragging Morty with him because the latter is still in detention.

Dread Nought tortures Sinistar-7 as punishment and orders his daughter to find Water-T and give him the \"I\" of Harmony.Meanwhile, Mr. Goldenfold takes a better look at the \"I\" of Harmony and sees that it has the Pythagorean Theorem etched onto the object. Goldenfold says he will try and decipher the message, but in exchange, he wants Water-T's homework. Water-T harshly agrees and leaves, causing Morty to ask his teach if there is more to this feud than math. Goldenfold said there was a time that Water-T was coming around to loving math, as he used a 4/4 time signature beat to help keep the time of his songs and managed to become a successful artist. However, something happened later that caused them to have a falling out, but Goldenfold refuses to tell Morty what it was. Goldenfold manages to solve the Pythagorean Theorem and locates a planet called Planet-E10. According to Water-T and Lithium-P, this planet was rumored to be the birth place of numbers and letters, and they decide to fly to the planet to see if there is something they can find. Water-T calls Oxygen-S and asks for reinforcements in their journey. But, once the call is finished, Oxygen-S secretly laughs diabolically.Water-T's group makes it to Planet-E10, with the \"I\" of Harmony glowing and letting them know that they are on the right path.

The group is surrounded by the natives of Planet-E10 called Googas, but they recognize the \"I\" of Harmony on Water-T and invite them to an Ewok party in their village. As they party, Sinistar-7 learns that the \"I\" of Harmony originated from a relic close to the village and informs Water-T about her findings. This leads to the two bickering again, causing Morty to comment that they are not so different. Using the Googas' scribble like bodies as an example, Morty tries to tell Water-T and Sinistar-7 are the same and their species do not need to be fighting. However, the two blow off Morty.The next day, Water-T wakes up to find Sinistar-7 and the \"I\" of Harmony missing, realizing that she went off on her own. Morty tries to get Mr. Goldenfold to come with Water-T and asks what really happened to cause their falling out. Goldenfold reveals that he was invited to the Governor's house for the 1991 Grammy Awards, back when the President was a State Governor, due to being a friend of Water-T. However, Water-T did not recognize Goldenfold or math in his acceptance speech, costing Goldenfold a new math wing for Harry Herpson High School. While sad to hear that, Morty convinces Goldenfold to help Water-T.Water-T stops Sinistar-7 at the relic, causing a brief fight that leads into a sex session. Doing so however causes the \"I\" of Harmony to show them the true origins of their races. Before they can explore more of this revelation, Lord Dread Nought and his forces land on Planet-E10 and capture everyone except for Sinistar-7. Oxygen-S reveals that he has been working for Dread Nought the entire team, and reveals that his true identity is Eight. As Mr. Goldenfold and Water-T bicker, Morty comes to his teacher's defense as he calls out the latter for snubbing math at the Grammys. However, Water-T explains why he did not thank math: he was called out by Magma-Q for using math for his album and got accused of caring about himself. Dread Nought has Eight use the \"I\" of Harmony on the pedestal, but the latter absorbs the power and transforms into Infinity. Infinity vaporizes Dread Nought and takes control of the Numericons, having his forces return to Alphebetrium and destroy the world. Water-T expresses disappointment that Sinistar-7 is following Infinity, but she coldly comments that numbers and letters were never going to be together.Water-T briefly turns back into Ice-T to free himself and the others. Thanks to the Googas repairing their ship using Sinistar7's ship, they are able to fly back to Alphebetrium in the Glyph Jumper Extreme so they can stop Infinity.Infinity destroys the brackets shield around Alphebetrium and has the Numericons attack the planet. However, it becomes clear that Infinity has become mad with power and starts killing his own men and young Alphebetrium. This horrifies Sinistar-7 and she demands that Infinity stops this mindless attack, but he shoots her ship down. The Glyph Jumper Extreme arrives to save Sinistar-7, who admits she was wrong in following Infinity and tells Water-T that the latter was also responsible in killing Magma-Q (the rock that killed him earlier turned out to be poisoned by Infinity). Water-T realizes that Morty was right all along, and tells Sinistar-7 that it is time for letter and numbers to unite. Using the power of hip-hop, they rally both races together to fight against Infinity, and the ghost of Magma-Q comes to help his son by turning Water-T into Magma-T. Magma-T reveals that he grabbed the \"I\" of Harmony before they left Planet-E10 and, as he and Sinistar-7 make out, the object turns into a large golden gun. Magma-T shoots Infinity in the dick, like he threatened to do earlier, and the latter explodes. With the battle over, Magma-T and Sinistar-7 consummate their new relationship as a new era for letters and numbers begins.Sometime later back at Harry Herpson High School, Morty is gleefully doing his math homework having gained a new respect for math and gives it to Mr. Goldenfold . Magma-T who's also in the class gives Mr. Goldenfold his long overdue homework assignment. Despite giving a bad grade, Goldenfold is more than happy to finally receive it.In the Post Credit Scene, rapper Ice Cube, who's revealed to be an alien called a Geomitron meets with Magma-T and Sinistar-7 to help save his home planet from an unknown force. The duo agree to help Ice Cube leading to a new movie called \"Magma-T & Ice Cube in: Challenge of the Geomitrons.\""}, "69": {"title": "Mort: Ragnarick", "text": "Jerry is in a white void, only for a golden light to appear in front of him as his Nana comes to greet him. However, Jerry's Pop Pop is not around, apparently getting annoyed by something that is going on. It turns out to be another of Rick's experiments, which involved Jerry momentarily dying and entering the afterlife so he can find a way to find a source of infinite energy. Of course, this proves to be a problem as Rick is so against religion, he cannot enter a traditional heaven like Jerry could. Fortunately, Rick manages to find an alternate way to enter the afterlife.Rick and Morty head to Norway and set up a bunker for the former's plan. Rick plans to enter Valhalla and set up an energy relay there so he can tap into the infinite energy for himself. And to make sure he dies a warrior's death, Rick has captured Bigfoot in a Pokeball, knowing that the latter will be enraged enough to kill him on sight. Sure enough, Bigfoot murders Rick in a brutal fashion, sending Rick's soul to Valhalla. Once there, Rick is killed again by a group of Vikings, only to be reborn in a tavern. Once Rick gets a layout of how the system works, he goes to a blacksmith's warehouse and knocks out the worker so he can get the materials he needs.Back on Earth, Morty sees Bigfoot bury Rick's body and prays for forgiveness. Believing that Bigfoot isn't a brute like Rick presumed he was, Morty tries to comfort the former, only to get killed himself and enter Valhalla unwillingly. The Vikings and Morty see what Rick did to the blacksmith, and the group confronts Rick. Rick tries to pass himself as Odin, but Morty's presence ruins the charade. After Rick kills the Vikings, he scolds Morty for letting Bigfoot fool him and has his grandson get to work getting the energy relay set up as they are pressed for time.With neither Rick or Morty around, Bigfoot attacks Rick's spare body that was supposed to be used after the energy relay network was built. However, a failsafe in the Operation Phoenix protocol activates, causing the spare body to jump out and act on survival instincts by running away. Bigfoot chases the Rick Clone into the city, only for him to get tranquilized by the police. Afterwards. two men in black suits come to take Bigfoot away, claiming that they work for the \"man from upstairs\".Bigfoot is taken to the Vatican as the Pope express interest in using the former to kill all of his enemies. To make sure Bigfoot follows his commands, the Pope reveals that they captured the Rick Clone and offers the latter to the former as his prize.In Valhalla, Rick and Morty try to work on building the relay while fighting against the Vikings simultaneously, as the former refuses to leave without getting his infinite energy. For the rest of the day, Morty uses every gadget Rick has to keep the Vikings away from the relay long enough for Rick to finish the relay. When Morty express concern about leaving the relay alone, Rick reveals he thought ahead. Rick and Morty destroy the tavern and trap the Vikings in a pit from the wreckage, telling them to stay away from the relay unless they want to be trapped in the pit forever.Meanwhile, the Pope has Bigfoot kill several members of the Pope's enemies, using the Rick Clone as the makeshift \"carrot and stick\" to do so. After Bigfoot receives a wrist device to communicate properly, he asks the Pope to give him what he wants.Rick and Morty leave Valhalla and go into new bodies, only to see that someone has hacked into the Earth side of the energy relay. Suddenly, Bigfoot storms into the garage and attacks Rick and Morty. Through Morty's urging, Rick apologizes to Bigfoot for bullying him for thinking he was stupid, but he brings up that while he used Bigfoot to kill him to enter Valhalla, the Pope has been using the latter to kill all of his enemies. Bigfoot realizes that the Pope was using him as a pawn and agrees to help Rick and Morty stop the Pope, with Rick upgrading his wrist device so he can speak without typing.Bigfoot takes Rick and Morty to the Vatican, managing to storm their way to the Pope. However, the Pope reveals that he has tapped into Rick's infinite energy and kills the trio, sending them back to Valhalla due to bein connected to the relay. The trio return to the relay and manage to get back to Earth, though Bigfoot ends up in a Summer Clone due to Rick's assessment of her being the third most likely to die in the family. Then, Rick sets up Operation Phoenix to be a vending machine like rotation as he feels they will die countless times.Sure enough, the trio die again, though when they return to Earth, Bigfoot gets his own human body thanks to Rick. They try again multiple times and go through multiple deaths, all getting themselves nowhere in stopping the Pope. In one attempt, they have Bigfoot's monster friends come to help them, but they all get killed. Realizing that this will go on forever, Rick tells Bigfoot to bring his friends to the relay as he and Morty go back to the Vikings. Rick admits he isn't Odin and gets the Vikings riled up by insulting their mothers, and he, Morty, and Bigfoot leave for Earth while the monsters handle the Vikings. When the trio return to the Vatican, the Pope tries to kill them again, but something happens to cause him to lose his infinite energy. This was Rick's plan all along, have the Vikings destroy the energy relay from Valhalla and cut the Pope off from the infinite energy. With the Pope powerless, Rick captures the latter in a Poke Ball.With the adventure over, Rick and Morty send Bigfoot into the woods to live his life, even though the latter argues he can live a normal life due to having a normal body.In the Post-Credit Scene, Rick is seen taking part in an illegal Pokemon battle using the Pope to battle another trainer when the FBI arrives and shuts the place down while Rick escapes via portal. After freeing him, the Pope asks who's running the Vatican to which the FBI shows a video of the Rick Clone as the new pope much to his horror."}, "70": {"title": "Fear No Mort", "text": " Rick and Morty explore a \"Carnival of Nightmares\" theme park on an alien planet and quickly realize that they are too desensitized to be afraid of any of the attractions. A man in a suit , claiming to be a fear connoisseur, approaches them and offers to show them the scariest place in the galaxy. The two accept, and allow the man to lead them to what looks like an unremarkable Denny's on Earth. The man in the suit wishes them good luck, and leaves. Assuming they've been conned into giving the strange man a free lift, Rick and Morty enter the restaurant and order food. Unexpectedly, the waiter informs them of the \"Fear Hole\" in the men's washroom. Rick and Morty find a strange hole on the ground in one of the stalls. A TV/VCR is setup next to the hole. The suited man appears on the TV and explains that the Fear Hole manifests one's greatest fear, giving one the opportunity to conquer it and emerge fearless (and also have their picture displayed on the restroom's bulletin board).Uninterested, Rick walks away, but Morty jumps right in. Inside, he faces a dark, monster-infested environment where creatures attempt to dissect him and stuff him with maggots. Rick follows in, arriving at the scene to fight off the monsters. He rescues Morty, and together they jump out of the hole to safety. Satisfied with their victory, Rick and Morty return home to the living room and brag about their feat. Suddenly, a portal appears in the ceiling from which a young Rick emerges, crashing into the room, protectively embracing his wife Diane . The younger Rick disintegrates, leaving the young Diane confused and distressed. Both Rick and Morty conclude that they must still be in the Fear Hole and head to the garage and discuss their predicament. Upon reflection, Rick surmises that to leave the Fear Hole, Morty must overcome his fear of seeing Rick happily reunited with Diane and of losing significance for Rick.  Morty finds Rick's theory backhanded. Rick, purportedly wanting to gather more data to confirm his theory, drops the conversation and decides to take Diane, Beth , and Morty out for ice cream.At the ice cream shop, Rick attempts to reconnect with Diane but it goes poorly; Rick's callous comments about the meaninglessness of the Fear Hole's reality upsets Diane. Rick's failure leads Morty to suggest that Rick's greatest fear may be of getting a second chance with Diane and failing. Rick rejects the idea, sticking to his original theory and arguing that the sooner he gets Diane back, the sooner Morty can conquer his fear of \"being a useless, lonely turd.\"The next day, Diane is awakened by a robot created by Rick that sings an apology and offers her breakfast. It breaks down before finishing its song, but Rick tells Diane it was supposed to invite her to the zoo with the family, an invitation she accepts. The two bond while watching ducks at the pond. Later, they grab drinks together, get seriously inebriated, and share a kiss under the rain. It becomes clear to Morty that Rick's endeavor to reconnect with Diane is no longer motivated by his desire to verify his theory about Morty's fear of losing Rick. Rick is falling back in love with the Diane he lost years ago, and he is showing signs of not caring that the world he is living in - the world of the Fear Hole - is not real. It also becomes apparent to Morty that Rick's reunion with Diane has come at a cost. The more time Rick spends with Diane, the more Rick's health appears to decline, as evidenced by his progressively emaciating face and body. Morty suggests to Rick that the hole is feeding off of him, but Rick does not care. Morty expresses that his greatest fear might be watching Rick die. Annoyed, Rick retaliates by telling Morty to stop watching.Leary of the consequences of being stuck in the Fear Hole, Morty returns to the Denny's to confront the man in the suit. Morty requests to be released from the hole, but the suited man refuses; releasing Morty would require also releasing Rick, which the suited-man is unwilling to do on account of Rick being a perfect Fear Hole victim, namely one preferring to die by the hole than face and overcome his fears. Discouraged, Morty returns home. He then notices that reality appears to become unstable whenever he contemplates overcoming his fear of not being `normal,' or of not being accepted by others. From this instability, Morty infers that this must be what the Fear Hole thinks is his greatest fear. Surmising that it may be more productive to face his own fears than to concentrate on Rick, Morty commits to overcoming his greatest fear by repeatedly exposing himself to embarrassing situations. Morty's efforts are rewarded. As he strives to overcome his fear, the Fear Hole's reality becomes increasingly unstable. This prompts Rick, who decidedly has no interest in leaving the hole, to interfere with Morty's plans. However, upon seeing the consequences that the Fear Hole has had on Morty's own body, Rick changes his mind, not wanting his own selfish desire of dying in the Fear Hole to cause Morty to die there as well. Rick says goodbye to Diane and helps Morty escape the Fear Hole by facing his fears alongside him.As the Fear Hole's reality appears to collapse, Rick and Morty emerge from the Fear Hole's orifice in the Denny's bathroom. Suspicious about still being in the Hole, Rick and Morty continue to contemplate their remaining fears, overcoming each one at a time, and repeatedly finding themselves emerging from the Fear Hole. (In order; Rick's fear of Morty knowing anything before him, Morty's fear that they will never escape the Hole because of Rick's stubborn refusal to admit his fears; Rick's fear of being proven wrong, Rick's fear of a side of bacon costing $8 (a \"symptom of a larger concern\" regarding the collapse of capitalism, according to Rick), Morty's fear of the Hole itself, and Morty's fear of eventually turning out like Jerry ). Exasperated by the unending string of deceptions, Morty finally gives up on tracking his fears and sits down next to the Hole next to Rick. Rick makes a small, seemingly innocuous comment to Morty about the latter being irreplaceable. This triggers Morty, causing him to realize what his deepest fear truly is: Morty is afraid of his own fungibility in Rick's eyes. It dawns on Morty that the Rick he has been with this whole time has merely been a manifestation of the Fear Hole; the real Rick never entered the Hole to begin with. With this, the Fear Hole itself, through the medium of fake-Rick, congratulates Morty on satisfying the Fear Hole's challenge. This allows Morty to finally exit the Fear Hole.Morty awakens at the bottom of the Hole to Rick watching him. When Morty asks why Rick didn't bother to jump in, Rick explains that he figured the Hole only works for one person at a time. Rick asks Morty of his experience. Distraught, Morty summarizes his traumatic tale and asks Rick whether he takes him to be irreplaceable. Rick replies with \"define irreplaceable\", which is enough to partially satisfy Morty, though he rejects a hug from Rick to prove he has escaped. Impressed by Morty's development, Rick suggests he go in next, but Morty begs him not to, describing the various horrors including seeing a version of Diane. The pair leave but Rick doubles back and considers entering the Hole in hopes of seeing Diane. Instead, he leaves a photo of Morty from his wallet on the bathroom bulletin board to honor his success.In the tag, Mr. Poopybutthole reminds the audience of how crazy Season 7 has been, and reveals that he stole one of Rick's portal guns. Mr. PB then travels to a reality where he is still happily married with Amy , knocking out and replacing the version of him therein, and disposing of him and the portal gun back through the portal. He tells the audience how being fulfilled is about having a goal and doing everything to achieve it. After Amy kisses him, Amy is shown to know that there is something off about her husband."}, "71": {"title": "Rick Can Handle It", "text": "In the atmosphere of Earth, the Vindicators, minus Rick and Morty, unite to take out Doom-Nomitron.
