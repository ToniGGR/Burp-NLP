Miss Hoover,"No, actually, it was a little of both. Sometimes when a disease is in all the magazines and all the news shows, it's only natural that you think you have it."
Lisa Simpson,Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
Miss Hoover,I don't know. Although I'd sure like to talk to him. He didn't touch my lesson plan. What did he teach you?
Lisa Simpson,That life is worth living.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"The polls will be open from now until the end of recess. Now, just in case any of you have decided to put any thought into this, we'll have our final statements. Martin?"
Martin Prince,I don't think there's anything left to say.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Bart?
Bart Simpson,Victory party under the slide!
,
Lisa Simpson,Mr. Bergstrom! Mr. Bergstrom!
Landlady,"Hey, hey, he Moved out this morning. He must have a new job -- he took his Copernicus costume."
Lisa Simpson,Do you know where I could find him?
Landlady,I think he's taking the next train to Capital City.
Lisa Simpson,"The train, how like him... traditional, yet environmentally sound."
Landlady,"Yes, and it's been the backbone of our country since Leland Stanford drove that golden spike at Promontory point."
Lisa Simpson,"I see he touched you, too."
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, thanks for your vote, man."
Nelson Muntz,I didn't vote. Voting's for geeks.
Bart Simpson,"Well, you got that right. Thanks for your vote, girls."
Terri/sherri,We forgot.
Bart Simpson,"Well, don't sweat it. Just so long as a couple of people did... right, Milhouse?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Uh oh.
Bart Simpson,Lewis?
Bart Simpson,Somebody must have voted.
Milhouse Van Houten,"What about you, Bart? Didn't you vote?"
Bart Simpson,Uh oh.
Bart Simpson,
Wendell Borton,Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
,
Bart Simpson,I demand a recount.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"One for Martin, two for Martin. Would you like another recount?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Well, I just want to make sure. One for Martin. Two for Martin."
Kid Reporter,"This way, Mister President!"
,
Conductor,"Now boarding on track 5, The afternoon delight coming to Shelbyville, Parkville, andâ€¦.."
Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Bergstrom! Hey, Mr. Bergstrom!"
BERGSTROM,"Hey, Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Lisa, indeed."
BERGSTROM,What? What is it?
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, I mean, were you just going to leave, just like that?"
BERGSTROM,"Ah, I'm sorry, Lisa. You know, it's the life of the substitute teacher: he's a fraud. Today he might be wearing gym shorts, tomorrow he's speaking French, or, or, or pretending to know how to run a band saw, or God knows what."
Lisa Simpson,You can't go! You're the best teacher I'll ever have.
BERGSTROM,"Ah, that's not true. Other teachers will come along who..."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, please."
BERGSTROM,"No, I can't lie to you, I am the best. But, you know, they need me over in the projects of Capital City."
Lisa Simpson,But I need you too.
BERGSTROM,That's the problem with being middle class. Anybody who really cares will abandon you for those who need it more.
Lisa Simpson,"I, I understand. Mr. Bergstrom, I'm going to miss you."
BERGSTROM,I'll tell you what...
BERGSTROM,"Whenever you feel like you're alone and there's nobody you can rely on, this is all you need to know."
Lisa Simpson,"Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom."
Conductor,All aboard!
Lisa Simpson,"So, I guess this is it? It you don't mind I'll just run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life?"
BERGSTROM,"Goodbye, Lisa honey. It'll be okay. Just read the note."
,
Homer Simpson,Never thrown a party? What about that big bash we had with all the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything?
Homer Simpson,"Bart didn't get one vote?! Oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. Alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. What are you so mopey about?"
Lisa Simpson,Nothing.
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, tell your father."
Lisa Simpson,Mr. Bergstrom left today.
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Lisa Simpson,He's gone. Forever.
Homer Simpson,And?
Lisa Simpson,I didn't think you'd understand.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand."
Lisa Simpson,"I'm glad I'm not crying because I would hate for you to think that what I'm about to say is based on emotion. But you, sir, are a baboon!"
Homer Simpson,Me?
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, you! Baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon!"
Homer Simpson,I don't think you realize what you're saying.
Lisa Simpson,Baboon!
Bart Simpson,"Whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. I just can't believe it was her."
Homer Simpson,"Did you hear that, Marge? She called me a baboon! The stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. There's a little girl upstairs who needs you. Her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her Daddy."
Homer Simpson,Go Away.
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, don't hold anything back. You can tell me. Are you crying because you called Daddy a baboon?"
Lisa Simpson,No!
Homer Simpson,Nuts.
Homer Simpson,This isn't going well at all.
Lisa Simpson,"Look, if you just want me to forgive you --"
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say."
Homer Simpson,"Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost someone special and it hurts. I'm lucky because I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under this roof."
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,That was our wedding.
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Marge Simpson,"Children, it's time for you to go to bed."
Homer Simpson,"It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, Lisa. There's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. Oh well, maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your doll house for you. At least, I'm good at monkey work. You know... monkey. You know what I mean?"
Lisa Simpson,Yeah.
Homer Simpson,I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
Lisa Simpson,You're so silly.
Homer Simpson,Gimme a banana.
Lisa Simpson,I don't have any banana.
Homer Simpson,"Come on, you're holding out on me."
Lisa Simpson,"I'm sorry I called you a baboon, Dad."
Homer Simpson,Think nothing of it.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's the matter, son?"
Bart Simpson,"Ah, Dad, if just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted..."
Homer Simpson,"Hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Would you have to do extra work?
Bart Simpson,Yeah.
Homer Simpson,"And is this Martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, no."
Homer Simpson,"So, let the baby have his bottle, huh? That's my motto."
Bart Simpson,"Hey! Thanks, monkey-man."
Homer Simpson,Holy-moly... talk about parenting!
Homer Simpson,Uh oh.
Homer Simpson,"Sleep well, Maggie. Ah, three for three."
Marge Simpson,"Homie, did you straighten everything out...?"
Homer Simpson,"Up... up... up... up... up... up. Don't say anything, Marge. Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life."
,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... hors doovers.
Marge Simpson,Homer! You promised!
Homer Simpson,I promised I wouldn't eat? Never! You lie!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please. We've never thrown a party. Now we're gonna pay back all the friends who've invited us to their homes."
Lisa Simpson,"But Mom, I want to hear the witty banter of sophisticated adults."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, you can't have any fun in bed."
Homer Simpson,"Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better."
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. Oh, baby! Mmmm. Yeah."
Marge Simpson,Oh! They're here! How does everything look?
Homer Simpson,How do I look?
Marge Simpson,Do we have enough glasses?
Homer Simpson,Do we have enough gag ice cubs?
Marge Simpson,Homer! Homer! Put a record on!
Homer Simpson,What are all our friends names again?
Marge Simpson,Children! Go!
Ned Flanders,"Hey, anybody mind if I serve as bartender? You know, I have a Ph.D in Mixology."
Moe Szyslak,College boy.
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer! Care to try some of my Flanders Planters punch?"
Homer Simpson,Why not? I paid for it.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it?"
Ned Flanders,"Au contraire, Simpson! It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor."
Homer Simpson,Really? Well I do have a warm sense of well-being and I seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! Give me another.
Marge Simpson,"Now, Homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. Remember last year at the Winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?"
Homer Simpson,No.
Marge Simpson,
,
,
Barney Gumble,"Hi! You're Homer's sister-in-law, right? I remember you, but I don't remember you being so beau --tiful."
Barney Gumble,Ow! Hey! Jeez!
Barney Gumble,Is that a new kind of Mace? It's really painful.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party?"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Uh, no, not really. Someone seems to have slipped one of those novelty ice cubes with a fake fly in my drink."
Homer Simpson,It was me! You fell for it!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Homer, these novelty ice cubes are often made from highly toxic chemicals. Ironically, a real fly would have been much more sanitary."
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,You should see the look on your face. It's priceless.
Homer Simpson,Bart! Come over here.
Bart Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,"You little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?"
Bart Simpson,Yes sir.
Homer Simpson,"Bart, do that thing you do that's so cute."
Bart Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,That thing you know how to do.
Bart Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,Go to bed.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody! Look, I'm the funniest guy in the world!"
Barney Gumble,"Oh, Homer, you're the king!"
Homer Simpson,"I've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but I've never had the nerve."
Husband Of Marge's Friend,"Homer, I don't know you. My wife and your wife are friends. We met just three hours ago."
Homer Simpson,You stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks! I quit!
Husband Of Marge's Friend,"Uh, gee Homer, don't quit..."
Homer Simpson,All right then.
Homer Simpson,Could you... give me a handful of peanuts... Maude?
Maude Flanders,Oh sure.
Homer Simpson,Not those peanuts. The ones at the bottom.
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,
Barney Gumble,"Hey, thanks for invitin' me. I had a wonderful time."
Marge Simpson,I must apologize for my husband.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"If you want him to live through the night, I suggest you roll him onto his side."
Marge Simpson,"Hmmm. thank you. I will, Dr. Hibbert. Thanks for coming."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Remember, I said if."
Marge Simpson,I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
Homer Simpson,Why? What'd you do?
Homer Simpson,Marge!
Marge Simpson,Come here!
Homer Simpson,Where-where are we going?
Marge Simpson,Shhh.
,
Marge Simpson,"I want to make sure the kids don't hear. When I was young, I always hated knowing my parents were fighting."
,
Bart Simpson,They're fighting in the car again.
Lisa Simpson,That music always sends a chill down my spine.
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night?"
Homer Simpson,The way I acted?
,
Homer Simpson,So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.
Sophisticate #1,Good lord! There's a fly in my drink!
Homer Simpson,I put it there.
Sophisticate #1,You did?
Homer Simpson,I slipped it into your glass as a gag.
Sophisticate #1,Pure hilarity!
Sophisticate #2,Pure Homer!
Sophisticate #3,I pronounce it to be the most whimsical jape of the season!
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I like to think that I'm a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!"
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, honey. Can't we just forget it and go to church."
Marge Simpson,I'm going to church alone today. You're going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred him for life.
Homer Simpson,"No, I didn't... I... Oh, you mean inside, don't you?"
,
Homer Simpson,About last night... you might have noticed Daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.
Bart Simpson,I understand why. You were wasted.
Homer Simpson,I admit it. I didn't know when to say when. I'm sorry it happened and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will."
Homer Simpson,Aw.
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now before I give you all a sneak preview of next week's sermon, I have some announcements to make. We have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack including ""Bible Bafflers"", ""Satan's Boners,"" ""Good Grief! More Satan's Boners"" and, for the teens, ""It's Not Cool To Fry In Hell."""
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Marge."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,I'm sorry. The Lord and I can't compete with the squeaking of Homer Simpson's shoes. Why don't we just put everything on hold until he takes a seat?
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Reverend."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Sit down, Homer."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Mrs. Lovejoy and myself will be holding our third annual marriage retreat next weekend at Catfish Lake. It's psychological counseling for couples whose marriages are hanging by a thread...
Marge Simpson,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,... or those just in need of a tune-up.
Homer Simpson,Hmmmm.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now if you wish to participate, please sign up on your way out after the service is over."
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Will the Simpsons be attending our little retreat?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well, it's very tempting. Really a wonderful idea."
Homer Simpson,Marge! What are you doing? Are you insane?!
Marge Simpson,We'll be there!
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Marriage encounter weekend, here I come!"
Bart Simpson,Now you wanna go?
Homer Simpson,They're holding it at Catfish Lake. They couldn't call it Catfish Lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.
Marge Simpson,We're going to this retreat to give our marriage a tune-up and that's all. No fishing.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that must be the babysitter."
Marge Simpson,Hello. I'm Mrs. Simpson.
Sultan,Simpson... Simpson...
Bart Simpson,"Come back for more, eh?"
Marge Simpson,Oh my. Where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice?
Homer Simpson,"Oh dear. If we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. What a kick in the teeth."
Bart Simpson,What do you need a babysitter for? I'm almost ten and a half.
Lisa Simpson,Mom! You wouldn't dare.
Bart Simpson,"Don't take that tone with me, young lady, or I'll give you a taste of the back of me hand."
Homer Simpson,"No, you don't!"
Marge Simpson,Grampa?
Grampa Simpson,Huh... who?... what?
Marge Simpson,"Grampa, could you do something?"
Grampa Simpson,I can dress myself.
Marge Simpson,"Well, I was wondering. Do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend? I wouldn't ask, except I'm desperate."
Grampa Simpson,"Oh sure. Last resort... Old Grampa, the feeb. The guy who can't be counted on for nothing, no how, dagnabit. Everyone's agin me. I'll do it."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk."
Marge Simpson,"Now, if Maggie runs a fever, you call this number. If she sticks her finger in an electrical socket, call this number. And if she drinks pine cleanser, call this..."
Grampa Simpson,Just give me the list. I can read.
Marge Simpson,"All right. All right. Goodbye, children. And behave yourselves."
Marge Simpson,Call this number if Grampa falls in the bathtub.
Grampa Simpson,I heard that.
Bart Simpson,"Grampa, Mom was in such a hurry, she forgot to give you this. It's a list of the things Lisa and I can and can't do."
Grampa Simpson,Uh huh .. Uh-huh... You're allowed smoke cigars?
,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, bait."
,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, better get some gas."
Homer Simpson,Fill 'er up. I guess I'll go and stretch my legs.
,
Worm Man,Where ya headed?
Homer Simpson,Catfish Lake.
Worm Man,"Oh, after General Sherman, are ya?"
Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who's General Sherman?"
Worm Man,He's only the biggest catfish in these parts...
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.
Worm Man,... they say he weighs upwards of five hundred pounds.
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, who says that?"
Worm Man,They do.
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Worm Man,"Now, that there's the only known picture of the General. Can't see what he is, exactly. He's freakishly big, though."
Homer Simpson,Hmmmm. Gentlemen: I am going to catch General Sherman!
,
Bart Simpson,"After the supermarket, we'll go to the video store, grab a Krusty Burger and head for the arcade."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, Grampa's a kindly old man who trusts us. Are you sure it's right to take advantage of him?"
Bart Simpson,"Lis, in these crazy, topsy-turvy times, who's to say what's right or wrong? But right now my gut's telling me... Bleed Gramps dry."
,
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson. Welcome!"
Marge Simpson,"Hello, Reverend. We're glad we could come. Oh, hello Helen."
HELEN,Hel-lo Marge!
Ned Flanders,"Why, Homer Simpson! Here to give your marriage a little spit shine?"
Homer Simpson,"None of your business, Flanders."
Homer Simpson,Uh say... uh... Reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, I'm afraid not. A marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours, Homer. It takes a whole weekend to do that."
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,We must bait our hooks with honesty. That way a happy marriage won't be the one that got away.
Homer Simpson,I see. I also understand bowling expressions.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Ah, three couples... our best turnout yet. Why don't we go around the room and everyone can introduce themselves and tell us a little bit about why they're here. John... Gloria?"
Gloria,"My name's Gloria. I'm here because Johnny boy hasn't been able to cut it, manwise, for some time. Not that I'd want his odor of gin and sour defeat pressed against me."
John,"That's enough, Gloria!"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Thank you, Gloria. John, why don't you tell us a little about why you're here?"
John,"She never cooks, she keeps a filthy house and she talks profanely. She's the Queen of the Harpies."
Gloria,"No, I'm not!"
John,Queen of the Harpies!
Gloria,"No, I'm not!"
John,"Here's your crown, your Majesty."
Gloria,"Get away from me, swine."
John,Queen of the Harpies!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"You've come to the right place. First, I want you to look into each other's eyes."
John,Your eyes? I'd forgotten how beautiful they are.
Gloria,Let's never fight again.
John,We were fools to argue.
Gloria,Let's not talk about that.
John,Let's not talk at all.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Remember my saving your lives and bringing you happiness when we pass the collection plate next week. All right. Ned, Maude, what brings you here?"
Ned Flanders,Well...
Maude Flanders,"Go on, Neddie."
Ned Flanders,"Sometimes Maude, God bless her, she underlines passages in my Bible because she can't find hers."
Homer Simpson,Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Homer, why are you here?"
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"No, no, Homer. Marge is going to tell us all your faults. Why don't you tell us about hers?"
Homer Simpson,She's perfect.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Come on, Homer. What are her faults?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, sometimes that can be annoying."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now, Marge. Don't interrupt. You'll get your turn."
Homer Simpson,I'm done.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Okay. Marge?
Marge Simpson,"Well, it's not that I don't love the guy. I'm always sticking up for him. It's just that he's so self-centered."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now, Homer."
Marge Simpson,"He forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes..."
Homer Simpson,It's true. It's all true.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Homer, don't interrupt."
Homer Simpson,Sorry.
Marge Simpson,"He blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle..."
Homer Simpson,I only did that a couple of times.
,
Lisa Simpson,Half a gallon of chocolate.
Bart Simpson,Check.
Lisa Simpson,Half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.
Bart Simpson,Check.
Lisa Simpson,"Half a gallon of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate chip."
Bart Simpson,Check.
Grampa Simpson,Did your Mom really write that shopping list?
Lisa Simpson,"Grampa, what a question?"
Bart Simpson,"What's next, Lis?"
Lisa Simpson,Sprinkles and syrup.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Grampa. Aisle six and step on it."
Grampa Simpson,"Well, all right, but put out that cigar."
,
Marge Simpson,"... He drinks out of the carton. He never changes the baby. When he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises. Oh... oh... and he scratches himself with his keys. I guess that's it. Oh no. Wait. He kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow. That's all I can think of right now. I guess you're all tired and I want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, we've missed the luau. What say we call it a night?"
,
Captain,"I don't want to hear it, McBain. That cannon of yours is against regulations. In this department we go by the book."
Grampa Simpson,"You know, kids, it's gettin' pretty late."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, you should go to bed, Grampa. We've had a big day."
Lisa Simpson,It's no use kidding myself. I'm having an ethical crisis.
,
Homer Simpson,"Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence. . The perfect crime."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you're sneaking out to go fishing? I can't believe your selfishness. You can go fishing anytime, but we're here trying to save our marriage. You're thinking about fishing, even when I'm talking... right now. Right?"
Homer Simpson,Would this be a good time to be honest?
Marge Simpson,Yes.
Homer Simpson,"You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy?"
Marge Simpson,Get back in bed.
Homer Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,All right. But I can't sleep. Can I take a walk?
Marge Simpson,Sure.
,
Homer Simpson,Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big ugly catfish. I gotta skillet and a stick of butter with your name on it."
,
Marge Simpson,Homer?
,
Grampa Simpson,Sugar?
Lisa Simpson,Yes. Ten please.
Bart Simpson,"Hey Grampa, top me off."
Grampa Simpson,Are you sure your ma lets you kids drink coffee?
Bart Simpson,"For the last time, yes!"
,
Homer Simpson,Good! Give up!
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Homer Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Milhouse. Big blowout at Casa de Simpson. The only adult is frail and old."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart's joint. Uh, twoish. Be there or be square."
,
Otto Mann,"Tell my friends? All right, but I've got some pretty funky friends."
,
Convict,All right! I get out at noon and I'm already invited to a party.
,
Helen Lovejoy,"Now, this is a trust exercise. You fall backwards and rely on your spouse to catch you."
Marge Simpson,Do I have to do this?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"No. Even if your husband were here, I wouldn't recommend it. Marge, as a trained marriage counselor, this is the first instance where I've ever told one partner that they were 100 percent right. It's all his fault, and I'm willing to put that in a certificate you can frame."
,
Grampa Simpson,Over there / Send the word / Send the word / Over there.
Grampa Simpson,That the Yanks are comin'...
,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show."
Homer Simpson,Whoa! Holy mackerel!
,
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, good to see you, pal. What's happening, man?"
Otto Mann,"Cherry party, Bart. Any chicks over eight?"
Bart Simpson,"Not yet, but the afternoon is young."
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, what's wrong?"
Lisa Simpson,Isn't it obvious? We've degraded ourselves and set back the children's rights movement for decades to come.
Bart Simpson,"You're great at a party, Lisa. Really great."
Grampa Simpson,"Hey you, no, shut that door! Stop it! Put that away! No, stop, oh!"
Grampa Simpson,OW!
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw haw!
Grampa Simpson,"You young hellion, do you want me to take off my belt?"
Nelson Muntz,Yeah.
Grampa Simpson,All right. I'll show you.
Nelson Muntz,Haw! Haw! Haw!
Grampa Simpson,Doggone it!
,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, but I must kill you."
,
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, take care, man. Hey, thanks for coming. Hey, nice tie, Nelson.."
Nelson Muntz,"Ah, thanks, it's your dad's."
Grampa Simpson,"I tried to be a good baby-sitter, but I failed! I'm a feeb... a useless old... worn-out..."
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, I have this strong unpleasant feeling I've never had before."
Lisa Simpson,"It's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepressible youth."
Bart Simpson,"Well, how do you make this feeling go away?"
Lisa Simpson,You grab a bucket and a brush and clean harder and faster than you ever have before.
,
Homer Simpson,I AM THE CHAMPIONS / I AM THE CHAMPIONS / NO TIME FOR LOSERS / CAUSE I AM THE CHAMPIONS / OF THE WORLLLLD!
Homer Simpson,"Uh, oh."
Homer Simpson,"Hi, honey. Uh, oh. How's the marriage retreat going?"
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Marge Simpson,"We came to this retreat because I thought our marriage was in trouble, but I never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. Homer, how can you expect me to believe...."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you don't know what this fish means. This fish represents a better life for both of us. This fish makes me a champion and a hero."
Marge Simpson,To who?
Homer Simpson,To those weirdos in the worm store.
Marge Simpson,All this fish represents is just how selfish you are.
Homer Simpson,"Well, if that's the way you feel... I'll throw it back."
Marge Simpson,"Oh yeah, sure."
Homer Simpson,Watch.
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I did it! I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. I fought it for six hours. She says one word and I toss it back. And you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? Come here, baby."
Marge Simpson,"Ohhh, Homer."
,
Homer Simpson,We're back!
Lisa Simpson,How's your marriage?
Homer Simpson,Same as usual. Perfectomundo.
Marge Simpson,"Oh my, the house looks wonderful. Grampa, what's your secret?"
Grampa Simpson,"Pretending to cry. That's right, you heard me. Pretending to cry. I can turn it on and off like a fawcet. Boo-hoo, Oh, I'm crying, I'm so sad."
Lisa Simpson,"Way to go, Grampa."
Bart Simpson,I'll never trust another old person.
Grampa Simpson,I fooled you. So long suckers. Hee hee hee.
,
Worm Man,"Yup. General Sherman. They say he's 500 pounds of bottom-dwelling fury, don't you know? No one knows how old he is, but if you ask me, and most people do, he's a hundred years if he's a day."
Customer,"And uh, no one's ever caught him?"
Worm Man,"Well, one fella came close. Went by the name of Homer. Seven feet tall he was, with arms like tree trunks. And his eyes were like steel, cold and hard. Had a shock of hair, red, like the fires of hell."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hurry, Mom! If we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will be gone."
Bart Simpson,Wow! Number nine! That's before Fallout Boy became his ward.
Bart Simpson,What do you care about good comics? All you ever buy is Casper the Wimpy Ghost.
Lisa Simpson,"I think it's sad that you equate friendliness from wimpiness, and I hope it will keep you from ever achieving true popularity."
Bart Simpson,"Well, you know what I think? I think Casper's the ghost of Richie Rich."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, they do look alike!"
Bart Simpson,I wonder how Richie died?
Lisa Simpson,"Perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money is, and took his own life."
Marge Simpson,"Kids, could you lighten up a little?"
Bart Simpson,"Now, Radioactive Man: He rules! Never punches a bad guy without saying something cool."
Lisa Simpson,He's no wittier than the next superhero.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah? Look. He knocks a guy into the sun and says, ""Hot enough for ya?"""
Lisa Simpson,I stand corrected.
Marge Simpson,We're here!
,
,
Lisa Simpson,Too bad we didn't come dressed as popular cartoon characters.
Bart Simpson,This looks like a discount for...
Bart Simpson,Bartman!
Ticket Seller,Who are you supposed to be?
Bart Simpson,I'm Bartman!
Ticket Seller,Never heard of him. Full price.
Bart Simpson,Lousy rip off...
DIAMOND JOE,"Is uh, this on?... Ahem, young people of Springfield: As your Mayor, I'd like to welcome you to our annual funny book convention, and thank you for pumping almost three hundred dollars into the local economy."
DIAMOND JOE,Your youthful high spirits have imparted a glow to this old war-horse. You might say I feel like Radiation Man!
Jimbo Jones,"That's Radioactive Man, jerk!"
DIAMOND JOE,"I stand corrected... Well, have fun and be sure to clear out by six for the Shriners. Get that punk's name. No one makes a fool out of Diamond Joe Quimby."
Martin Prince,"Excuse me, sir. Has anyone turned in a left Vulcan ear?"
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Lost And Found Guy,"Let's see, we've got a utility belt, a couple of tricorders, a light saber... Sorry, kid."
Otto Mann,"Hey, Bart-dude!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Otto-man! Oooh, what's that?"
Otto Mann,"My very own idea for a comic book, little man. It's about a dude who drives a school bus by day, but by night, fights vampires in a post-apocalyptic warzone!"
Bart Simpson,Cool!
Milhouse Van Houten,"C'mon, Bart. We're going to see Buddy Hodges."
Bart Simpson,The guy who played Fallout Boy on TV?
Milhouse Van Houten,Yep.
Bart Simpson,"Wow, I guess he wasn't killed in Vietnam."
Radioactive Man,Aaahh... These Laramie cigarettes give me the steady nerves I need to combat evil.
Fallout Boy,"Gee whillikers, Radioactive Man. Wisht I was old enough to smoke Laramies."
Radioactive Man,"Sorry, Fallout Boy, not until you're sixteen."
Radioactive Man,Look out!
Announcer,Will Radioactive Man act in time to save the earth?
Convention Director,"Well, wasn't that great?... Y'know, kids, I'm sure we'd all like to remember actor Dirk Richter for his portrayal of Radioactive Man, and not the sordid details of his final years, so let's keep the questions tasteful, okay? Now how about a big welcome for Buddy ""Fallout Boy"" Hodges!"
BUDDY,Any questions?
Milhouse Van Houten,"When Radioactive Man got injected with shrinking serum in issue two-thirty-four, how come his costume shrinks, too?"
BUDDY,"I am sure I don't know. But I did just finish playing Rum Tum Tugger in the second national touring company of ""Cats"" -- anybody see it?"
Bart Simpson,"Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Over here, Fallout Boy! Oh, oh, me... me... me... me, me."
BUDDY,"Yes, you, the masked boy."
Bart Simpson,Do you think the ghost of Dirk Richter haunts the bordello where his bullet-riddled body was found?
BUDDY,Dirk Richter was a beautiful man. Can't you little vultures leave him alone?
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, Radioactive Man number seventy-two! It's the imaginary tale where Radioactive Man marries Larva Girl."
Dealer,Tell you what. I'll show you something very special if you promise to put your grubby little hands behind your back and keep 'em there.
Dealer,Behold!
Bart Simpson,Wow. Radioactive Man Number One.
Dealer,None other.
Bart Simpson,I bet it's worth a million bucks!
Dealer,"It is, my lad. But I'll let you have it for a hundred because you remind me of me."
Bart Simpson,All I got is thirty.
Dealer,Then you cannot have it.
Bart Simpson,"But I must. Until this moment, I never knew why God put me on this earth, but now I know... to buy that comic book."
Dealer,"Your emotion is out of place here, son."
,
Marge Simpson,"So, did you kids have fun?"
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, Mom! Guess what? For a dollar a man sold me thirty-five Caspers and a dozen Lois Lanes."
Marge Simpson,Ohhh.
Homer Simpson,I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman! And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time.
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,"I was just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat!"
Bart Simpson,"All right, Homer. Whoa, you really are a sport, Dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like Krusty Burger!"
Homer Simpson,"All right, what are you getting at?"
Bart Simpson,I need a hundred dollars for a comic book.
Homer Simpson,"A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?"
Bart Simpson,"Oh please, Dad. I want this more than anything in the world."
Homer Simpson,"Well, t.s."
,
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,"No! Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so I'm not mad at you for trying. It shows you've been paying attention. But we all know I'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,Okay.
Homer Simpson,"Hee hee, I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Woo hoo hoo!"
Marge Simpson,"Don't gloat, Homer. You know, Bart, when I was your age, the one thing I wanted more than anything in the world was a Child-sized Electric Lightbulb Oven. My parents wouldn't give me the money, so I went to my sisters, Patty and Selma..."
,
Young Patty,We'll give you half our allowance.
Young Selma,Uh-huh. But you have to be our slave.
Young Patty,This gives us a lot more free time.
Young Selma,Uh-huh. Let's take up smoking.
Marge Simpson,"For months, I worked and worked, while my sisters smoked and smoked..."
Older Patty,"Venus... Oh, Venus..."
Older Selma,We want those dress-shields hand-washed and drip-dried.
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
Mrs. Glick,Here we are.
Marge Simpson,"But the big day finally came. And because I'd worked for it, all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good."
,
Marge Simpson,So maybe a part-time job is the answer.
Bart Simpson,"Aw, Mom, I couldn't ask you to do that. You're already taking care of Maggie, and Lisa is such a handful --"
Lisa Simpson,"She means you should get a job, stupid."
Bart Simpson,Me?
Adult Narrator,"Get a job! Were they serious? I didn't realize it at the time, but a little piece of my childhood had slipped away... forever."
Homer Simpson,Bart! What are you staring at?
Bart Simpson,Uh... nothing.
Adult Narrator,"He didn't say it, and neither did I, but at that moment my dad and I were closer than we ever..."
Homer Simpson,Bart! Stop it!
Bart Simpson,Sorry.
,
Bart Simpson,I NEED SOME MONEY / A LOT OF MONEY... AHH
Bart Simpson,Empty bottles... empty bottles...
Bart Simpson,"Hm... well, it's practically empty."
,
Bart Simpson,"Here you go, Apu."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Ooh, very good. Would you like the deposit defrayed from the cost of a Jumbo Cherry Squishie?"
Bart Simpson,"No, not today. I need the dime."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, it is good to see you are learning a trade."
,
Bart Simpson,Ah-ha!
,
Bart Simpson,"Americanize this, my good man."
Teller,Okey dokey.
Bart Simpson,All those coins were only worth three lousy cents?
Teller,Let the good times roll.
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, this is so humiliating... I feel like such a geek."
Lisa Simpson,"How's it going, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,"Terrible. Cars slow down to laugh at me, but no one's buying."
Lisa Simpson,Maybe you need to play on their sympathies more. Lets see...
Lisa Simpson,"Ah ha, now you look pathetic."
Bart Simpson,Lemonade sucks. I need a new product. Let's see... ... Ah!
Bart Simpson,"Form a line, no crowding. Cheap beer and a sympathetic ear... Step right up."
Barney Gumble,"Ah, Bart could you give me one on credit? I'm a little short this week."
Bart Simpson,Beat it.
Eddie,"Say, uh, you got a liquor license there, young fella?"
Bart Simpson,"Ugh, my dog ate it."
Lou,Gotta have a license to sell beer.
Bart Simpson,Say... writing all those tickets must make you guys thirsty. How about a couple on the house?
Eddie,"We-ell, seeing as how it's a first offense..."
Lou,I guess we can overlook this.
Bart Simpson,"So long, officers. Uh-oh."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's all the --"
Homer Simpson,My beer... my beer... my beautiful beer.
,
Marge Simpson,The poor boy is so desperate. He wants to earn money to buy a comic book.
Mrs. Glick,"A comic book! Oh, my, boys never change. Which one is it, ""Nazi Smasher""?"
Marge Simpson,I don't think so.
Mrs. Glick,"Send him over to my house, I got a few chores he could do. He knows how to mix whitewash, don't he?"
,
Bart Simpson,Mrs. Glick?
Mrs. Glick,"Eh, you must be Burt Simpson! Well, you look like you've got a strong young back!"
Mrs. Glick,"Would you like something to eat? I've got dried apricots... almond paste, sauerkraut candy."
Bart Simpson,"No, thanks. Who's that?"
Mrs. Glick,"Oh, that's my brother, Asa. He was killed in the Great War. Held a grenade too long."
,
Asa,"This one's for you Kaiser Bill. Special delivery from Uncle Sam and all the boys in D Company: Yeah! Johnny, Harrison, Brooklyn Bob and Reggie. Yeah, even Reggie. He ain't so stuck-up once you get to know..."
Mrs. Glick,"Here, have some ribbon candy. Boys love candy."
Bart Simpson,"No, thanks."
Mrs. Glick,Boys love candy.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yes, ma'am!"
Bart Simpson,"Ugh, I think I'd rather just get to work, Ma'am."
Mrs. Glick,"We'll start with a little light yard work. And when you're done, you can have a nice barley pop."
,
Mrs. Glick,I want you to clear out all the weeds. You do know which ones are weeds?
Bart Simpson,All of 'em?
Mrs. Glick,Good boy.
Mrs. Glick,Now be careful with these. I'll be inside watching my stories.
Bart Simpson,Ow!. . .Ow!
Soap Actress,"Jack, please. I'm married."
Soap Actor,That must be what's turning me on.
Soap Actress,Oh... Stop it... some more.
Mrs. Glick,"Filthy, but genuinely arousing."
Bart Simpson,Finished.
Mrs. Glick,"Merciful heavens, you're bleeding! I'll get the iodine."
Mrs. Glick,"Now, don't fidget."
Bart Simpson,"Listen, lady, you don't have to -- YAAAUUUUGGGHHH!"
Mrs. Glick,They've never improved on iodine.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hi, Mom."
Marge Simpson,Did you make any money?
Bart Simpson,"Not yet, but at least I'm in a lot of pain."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I think what you're doing for Mrs. Glick is very nice. The poor old thing doesn't have anybody."
Bart Simpson,There's a reason.
Mrs. Glick,"The sludge certainly collects around those downspouts, don't it?"
Bart Simpson,"I'll sludge you, you old bat."
Mrs. Glick,"Today, we wash Beulah. Do you know what that is?"
Bart Simpson,"Some old lady thing, nobody's heard about for fifty years?"
Mrs. Glick,"No, it was my wedding dress, but then I dyed it black and it became my mourning dress."
Bart Simpson,"Great story, lady."
Bart Simpson,Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms.
Bart Simpson,"No! No, not the iodine! Burn the germs off with a torch, amputate my arm, but not the -- YAAAUUUGGGHHH!"
,
Mrs. Glick,"Well, it's payday. I'll wager you've been looking forward to this."
Chimp,
Mrs. Glick,Two quarters.
Bart Simpson,Two quarters?
Mrs. Glick,"You deserve every penny. You know, I've told a lot of my girlfriends about you and they have chores too."
Bart Simpson,Two quarters!
Mrs. Glick,"Bart, you didn't say thank you."
Bart Simpson,"Listen lady, I can leave without screaming, and I can leave without saying a bad word, but there's no way that I am saying thank you."
Mrs. Glick,"You're welcome. All right then, off you go, to spend it on penny whistles and moon pies."
,
Bart Simpson,"Moon pies, my butt... Somebody oughta moon pie her..."
Homer Simpson,"What's the problem, boy?"
Bart Simpson,"I've been bustin' my hump all week for that withered old clam, and all I got was fifty cents."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money."
Bart Simpson,Really?
Homer Simpson,Nah.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I've done everything I could and I've only got thirty-five bucks. Ugh.. I am through with working. Working is for chumps."
Homer Simpson,"Son, I'm proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out."
,
Martin Prince,Can you let me have it for forty dollars?
Dealer,Forty bucks? Forget it! You made me get off my stool for that?
Martin Prince,"It's all I've got. I sold seeds. I visited my aunt in the nursing home. I fished a dime out of the sewer, for God's sake!"
Dealer,No way. What do you want?
Bart Simpson,Can I have it for thirty-five?
Dealer,"No!... No!... Freakin' kids. I do not need this, I've got a Masters degree in folklore and mythology."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Excuse me, do you have the Carl Yastrzemski baseball card from 1973, when he had big sideburns?"
Dealer,"Show me the thirty bucks, because if you ain't got it, I ain't gettin' off the stool."
Bart Simpson,"Wait a minute, Martin. If you, Milhouse and I went in together, we could buy a copy of ""Radioactive Man No. 1"" right now!"
Martin Prince,Wow!
Dealer,"Here you go. ""Muttonchop Yaz."""
Milhouse Van Houten,I don't want it.
Dealer,Freakin' kids!
Bart Simpson,"Look, pal. We've got a hundred bucks and we'd like to buy ""Radioactive Man No. 1"". So why don't you just waddle over there and get it."
Dealer,Yes sir.
Bart Simpson,"Wow! Breathe it in, boys!"
Martin Prince,This is the stuff dreams are made of.
Milhouse Van Houten,It smells like my grandpa.
Bart Simpson,"Uh-oh, looks like rain. We better get this baby home."
Bart Simpson,Uh-oh.
Dealer,Looks like you bought more than you bargained for.
,
Radioactive Man,My pants... caught on barbed wire... Good Lord Choke... an A-bomb!
Radioactive Man,Yaarrgh!
Radioactive Man,"I'm becoming radioactive. From this day forward, I shall call myself Radioactive Man."
Milhouse Van Houten,So that's how it happened!
Martin Prince,I would've thought being hit by an atomic bomb would have killed him.
Bart Simpson,Now you know better.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Turn the page, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Listen, you guys are welcome to come over and read it any time you like."
Milhouse Van Houten,Why can't we keep it at my house?
Bart Simpson,Your house? That's crazy talk!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, the comic's ours as much as it is yours."
Martin Prince,"How about this, guys. Bart can have it Mondays and Thursdays. Milhouse will get it Tuesdays and Fridays. And yours truly will take it Wednesdays and Saturdays."
Bart Simpson,Perfect.
Milhouse Van Houten,Wait a minute. What about Sunday?
Bart Simpson,Yeah. What about Sunday?
Martin Prince,"Well, Sunday possession will be determined by a random number generator. I will take the digits one through three. Milhouse will have four through six. And Bart will have seven through nine."
Bart Simpson,Perfect.
Milhouse Van Houten,Wait a minute. What about zero?
Bart Simpson,Yeah! What about zero?
Milhouse Van Houten,Yeah.
Martin Prince,"Well, in the unlikely event of a zero, possession will be determined by ""Rock, Scissor, Paper"" competition. Best three out of five, how's that?"
Martin Prince,"Excellent! Well, today being Saturday, Gentlemen, I guess I'll be taking my comic and..."
Bart Simpson,"Uh, uh, uh, ah nice try, Martin. It almost worked. But tonight, this comic book stays right here."
Martin Prince,"If the comic book stays right here, then so do I."
Milhouse Van Houten,Me too!
Bart Simpson,"Fine. We're all going to stay here with the comic book. It'll be like a sleep-over. Yeah, a sleep-over. That's what pals do, right? Real friendly-like."
Milhouse Van Houten,I want to read it again.
Bart Simpson,"Nice try, mister."
Martin Prince,"Milhouse, the acids in your hands could damage the newsprint. We want to keep this comic forever, so the last one alive will have the honor of being buried with it."
Bart Simpson,"What do you mean, the last one alive?"
Martin Prince,I meant years from now.
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, sure you did."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, don't push him!"
Bart Simpson,"I knew it. You're both against me! Well, nobody makes a sap out of Bartholemew J. Simpson."
Marge Simpson,I thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s'mores.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Thank you, Mrs. Simpson."
Bart Simpson,"Sweet dreams, boys."
,
,
Bart Simpson,One more step and you're a dead man.
Martin Prince,"I have to go to the bathroom, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, right, so do I, but you don't see me gettin' up."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, what's going on?"
Bart Simpson,Our dear friend Martin was trying to steal the comic book.
Milhouse Van Houten,Let's tie him up!
Martin Prince,"Bart, is this how you treat all your guests?"
Bart Simpson,"Hmp, impressive."
Bart Simpson,"Quiet, Piggy, or we'll stick an apple in your mouth. We can't take any chances. We'll have to take turns watching him."
Milhouse Van Houten,Okay. I'll go first.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, so that's your little game. Let old Bart get nice and drowsy, then, when his back is turned... wham!"
Bart Simpson,"Well, it is not going to happen, see?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"You're going crazy, Bart. I'm telling your mom!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey Martin, tell him what we do with squealers."
Martin Prince,I don't know. Is it worse than what you do with people that have to go to the bathroom?
Milhouse Van Houten,You can't stop me.
Bart Simpson,The hell I can't!
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys?"
Homer Simpson,They're fine.
,
Martin Prince,"Bart, the comic!"
Milhouse Van Houten,Don't let go of me Bart!
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, it's not that far to the ground. And the rain has probably softened it up a bit."
Milhouse Van Houten,"No, Bart! No!"
Martin Prince,"You know, if you guys hadn't tied me up, I could be saving the comic as we speak."
Bart Simpson,Shut up! Shut up!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Help me, Bart! I didn't even want the comic. I wanted Carl Yastrzemski with the big side-burns."
Marge Simpson,"Boys, you better come in the house. You don't want to get the sniffles."
Bart Simpson,"Aw, Mom."
Marge Simpson,Now come on... You can play your little tie-up game inside. I've got some cocoa on the stove. Who wants imitation marshmallows?
Martin Prince,"I'd raise my hand, Mrs. Simpson, if I could."
,
Homer Simpson,
Martin Prince,"It's no use, fellows. Another comic book has returned to the earth from whence it came."
Bart Simpson,We worked so hard and now it's all gone... We ended up with nothing because the three of us can't share.
Milhouse Van Houten,What's your point?
Bart Simpson,Nothing. It just kind of ticks me off.
Radioactive Man,"Well, the world is safe again... but for how long?"
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Ah, Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee, distinguished guests. I am pleased to dedicate this emergency warning system. In the uh, off chance of a nuclear disaster, this sign will tell you, the good citizens of Springfield, what to do."
Homer Simpson,"Joke's on them. If the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"And now, I would like to present the man who made this sign possible, by dropping the last of his obstructionist legal challenges... Montgomery Burns."
Waylon Smithers,Mr. Burns is never late. Something must be terribly wrong.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Well, there better be. Nobody leaves Diamond Joe Quimby holding the bag!"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Must... turn... over. Got to... greet... dignitaries!
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, no, Mr. Burns! We've got to get a doctor!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Absolutely not! No quack sawbones is going to apply his leeches to me! As long as there's an ounce of strength left in me, I..."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Mmmm. Mr. Burns is suffering from what we medical men call hypohemia. In layman's terms it's quite simply a lack of blood.
Waylon Smithers,"Damn it, doctor, I'm no idiot! I know what hypohemia is. What I want to know is what can we do about it?"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, at this point, our only hope is a transfusion."
Waylon Smithers,How long does it take to sterilize a needle?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,A few seconds.
Waylon Smithers,"Well, skip it."
Waylon Smithers,Just leave me enough to get home.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,I'm afraid it's not that simple. His blood type is Double-O-Negative. It's quite rare.
Waylon Smithers,But I'm B positive. Damn this common gutter blood in my veins!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, don't feel so bad. After all, that kidney you donated to me really hit the spot."
,
Homer Simpson,How many hairs on my head? Without looking!
Waylon Smithers,Go ahead.
Chimp,
Waylon Smithers,"Attention all employees. Our boss and inspiration, Mr. Burns... is at death ... death's door. If you have type Double-O-Negative blood, I implore you to report to the Bloodmobile outside. That is all."
Carl Carlson,"I'd give him my blood, except for one thing."
Lenny Leonard,What's that?
Carl Carlson,I don't wanna.
Homer Simpson,"I can't believe you guys. There's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. And you don't wanna cash in? That's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job."
Carl Carlson,"You know, Homer, I am your supervisor."
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, sir."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Maggie, look. What's that?"
Lisa Simpson,Lee-mur. Lee-mur.
Lisa Simpson,Zee-boo. Zee-boo.
Marge Simpson,"What are you doing, honey?"
Lisa Simpson,I'm trying to teach Maggie that nature doesn't end with the barnyard. I want her to have all the advantages that I didn't have.
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, we did the best we could... What's a zebu?"
Lisa Simpson,"It's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. Hump and dew-lap. Hump and dew-lap."
Homer Simpson,Marge! Marge! What's my blood type?
Marge Simpson,A-Positive.
Homer Simpson,"Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don't have it."
Lisa Simpson,"You know his blood type, how romantic."
Marge Simpson,A mother knows everything about her family.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, yeah? What's my shoe size?"
Marge Simpson,Four B.
Bart Simpson,How many teeth do I have?
Marge Simpson,"Sixteen permanent, eight baby."
Homer Simpson,Earmuffs.
Marge Simpson,XL.
Lisa Simpson,Ring.
Marge Simpson,"I don't want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three."
Bart Simpson,Allergies.
Marge Simpson,Butterscotch and imitation butterscotch.
Bart Simpson,And?
Marge Simpson,Glow in the dark monster make-up.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie, you have lots of hair... Why did you want to know your blood type?"
Homer Simpson,"Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it."
Marge Simpson,Bart does.
Homer Simpson,"Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! You've got a date with a needle!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, wait a minute. I don't have to give blood. I have rights, you know."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you have the right to remain silent."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, you have to help someone in need. It's the only decent thing to do."
Bart Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, it's not like I'm asking you to give blood for free. That would be crazy! You're a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. Don't you know the story of Hercules and the Lion?"
Bart Simpson,Is it a Bible story?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches."
Bart Simpson,How did a lion get rich?
Homer Simpson,It was the olden days!
Bart Simpson,Oh.
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, let's go! Emergency! Life-or-death here!"
Otto Mann,"Just a sec, man!"
,
Bart Simpson,"Whoa, Otto-man! You work here?"
Otto Mann,"Oh yeah! During the day, all my friends are in school, so I got a job as a Certified Bloodletting Tech Dude."
Homer Simpson,Now let's get the show on the road.
Otto Mann,Okay. Let me wash up.
Waylon Smithers,"Homer, brave young Bart. I don't know which one to hug first."
Homer Simpson,Eh.... the boy.
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,We're ready with the transfusion.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm not going to make it. I want to dictate... my epitaph."
C. Montgomery Burns,Charles... Montgomery... Burns.
Waylon Smithers,"Um, hmm."
C. Montgomery Burns,American Patriot
C. Montgomery Burns,... American Patriot.
C. Montgomery Burns,Master Of The Atom.
C. Montgomery Burns,Scourge Of The Despot.
C. Montgomery Burns,"""O Tyrant Hear His Mighty Name And QUAKE!!"" Smithers, I'm back!"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, top o' the mornin' to ye! Why, look who's here! It's good old... you!"
Smitty,"Hi, Mr. Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, hey, there, Mr... Brown Shoes! How about that local sports team? Hm?"
Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns... he's okay! Jackpot!
,
Osvaldo,"Aye, caramba!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Heh-heh-heh! Well, that's game! Hasta manana, Osvaldo!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm back in the pink! Full of pith and vinegar!"
Waylon Smithers,"Just remarkable, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know, it's funny, Smithers. I tried every tincture and poultice and tonic and patent medicine there is. And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy. By the way, what was the lad's name?"
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, Bart Simpson, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Who?
Waylon Smithers,He's the son of Homer Simpson. One of your stiffs in Sector 7-G.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, the Simpsons will be getting a very nice surprise in the mail. Very nice, indeed."
,
Homer Simpson,"Bill... Bill... Summons... Bill... Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns? Is this it? Yes, this is it! Woo-hoo! Woo!"
Homer Simpson,Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, dim the lights! No, turn on more lights! But do something!"
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"It's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check."
Marge Simpson,The meaning of what?
Homer Simpson,"""Better half,"" Marge. ""Better half."""
,
Homer Simpson,"All right, there's no check, just a card. But don't panic. I'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. ""Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns."" It's just a card!"
Homer Simpson,"This is some way to show your gratitude. No gold. No diamonds. No rubies. Not even a lousy card. Wait a minute, there was a card. That's what got me so mad in the first place."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. You do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're my wife and I love you very much. But you're living in a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats..."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, Mom. We got hosed!"
Homer Simpson,Bart!
Marge Simpson,We got exactly what we wanted out of this: We gave an old man a second chance.
Homer Simpson,"I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I've had it! Bart, take a letter."
Homer Simpson,"""Dear Mr. Burns. I'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your caard was just great. In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic. You stink!"" Could you read that last part back to me?"
Bart Simpson,You stink.
Homer Simpson,"Good. ""You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."""
Bart Simpson,An elephant's butt?
Homer Simpson,An elephant's butt.
,
Marge Simpson,But he's your boss. Do you have to mail it right this minute?
Homer Simpson,Yup!
Marge Simpson,"You're still angry, Homer. Why don't you sleep on it?"
Homer Simpson,"Forget it, Marge!"
Marge Simpson,"Please, Homie? For me?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all right. You always do that hand thing! And it usually works."
,
Homer Simpson,Cheap son-of-a...
Marge Simpson,Homer... Breakfast is ready.
Homer Simpson,Hmmm...
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. Y'know, I finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph."
Marge Simpson,Oh... thank you.
Homer Simpson,Where's the letter?
,
,
Homer Simpson,Where is it?
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I don't think it's in the cornstarch canister."
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up and walk away!"
Homer Simpson,"Bart, have you seen the letter?"
Bart Simpson,Yup.
Homer Simpson,"All right, think very carefully. Where did you see it last?"
Bart Simpson,The last place I saw it...
Homer Simpson,Uh huh.
Bart Simpson,...was in my hand...
Homer Simpson,Yeah...
Bart Simpson,...as I was shoving it into the mailbox.
Homer Simpson,Why did you do that?
Bart Simpson,"Dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. And I know you. You're an emotional guy. Just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you'd be mad in the morning. So I..."
Homer Simpson,I'll show you mad in the morning.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you encouraged him. You should be strangling yourself."
Homer Simpson,"She's right. Okay, think, Homer. Don't panic. They don't pick up the mail till noon. There's still time!"
,
Homer Simpson,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Bart Simpson,"Give it up, Homer. It's locked up tight."
Homer Simpson,"Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy."
Barney Gumble,"Hey, I'm with you, Homer. Fight the power!"
Bart Simpson,"Why the hose, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,"What does it look like? I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?"
Homer Simpson,"So a few people won't get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: ""Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo."" Big loss."
Homer Simpson,"Now Bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, the mailman is here."
Homer Simpson,That's a good one. We'll use that.
Bart Simpson,"No, I mean the mailman's here."
Homer Simpson,
Mail Person,Dear God! Are you planning to water the mail?
Homer Simpson,"Uh, uh I-I guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?"
Mail Person,That's right.
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm still gonna run!"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,I want the whole world to hear the story of my harrowing struggle with hypohemia.
Waylon Smithers,"Well, sir, Mr. Roman is one of the finest ghostwriters in the business."
Waylon Smithers,"He's written ""Like Hell I Can't!""... ""Up From The Muck""... and ""The Unsinkable Sadruddin Mahbaradad!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent.
Roman,"All right, all right. First question? Have you slept with anyone famous?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Countess Van Zeplin and I... What in blaze... Now you listen to me, you bargain basement Baudelaire. I'm not some dizzy starlet who can't string two words together. I can write this thing myself. You're fired."
,
,
Postal Worker,"Okay, Mr. Burns. What's your first name?"
Homer Simpson,I don't know.
Homer Simpson,"Great plan, Bart."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Ooh, look, Maggie, what is that? Do-dec-ah-edron. Dodecahedron."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Chapter the Fifth... A Trip to the Infirmary, With Most Unexpected Results."""
,
Homer Simpson,Oops.
Homer Simpson,Twenty eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for operation Mail Take.
C. Montgomery Burns,Can I help you?
Bart Simpson,"They always told me I was gonna destroy the family, but I never believed it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, don't be frightened of this. It's nothing but a letter opener. Who are you?"
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson.
,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well I'll be on my --"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello, there's more. ""In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic..."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"""...you stink, you are a senile, buck-toothed..."" ""...old mummy... with bony girl arms and you smell like an elephant's butt!"""
Homer Simpson,"Hey, c'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm?"
Joey,"Homer, I don't tell you how to do your job. Okay?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I could crush him like an ant, but it would be too easy. No, revenge is a dish best served cold. I'll bide my time until... Oh, what the hell. I'll just crush him like an ant."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Senile,"" eh? ""Buck-toothed,"" am I? ""Bony arms,"" are they? ""Liver spots,"" did I? ""Chinless,"" will you?"
Waylon Smithers,"His pink slip awaits your signature, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, that's odd. I've just robbed a man of his livelihood, and yet I feel strangely empty. Tell you what, Smithers. Have him beaten to a pulp."
Waylon Smithers,"But, sir --"
C. Montgomery Burns,But what?
Waylon Smithers,"Nothing, sir."
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I've never seen Mr. Burns this mad and he's always kinda mad."
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Me and my big... letter writing pen!
Marge Simpson,"Honey, what's done is done. No matter what happens, we'll pull through. We always do."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, here's the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I'll... die in a gutter. It's practical and within our means."
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"That's okay, Bart. Nobody really believed it. We were just trying to scare you."
,
Waylon Smithers,You know Homer Simpson?
Joey,"Yeah, nice guy. Play poker with him once in a while."
Waylon Smithers,"Hmmm huh. We uh, need him beaten up."
Joey,You got it.
Waylon Smithers,Wait!
Joey,What is it?
Waylon Smithers,"Ah, nothing."
Waylon Smithers,Wait!
Joey,What?
Waylon Smithers,"Beat, but don't kick."
Joey,Hold the kicks. Got it.
Waylon Smithers,Wait!
Joey,What?
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, um, umm..."
Joey,"Hey, what did Homie do anyway?"
Waylon Smithers,He saved Mr. Burns' life!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"In closing, gentle reader, I'd like to thank you. What's that you say? Me thanking you? No, it's not a misprint. For you see, I enjoyed writing this book as much as you enjoyed reading it. The end."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah Smithers, how'd the beating go?"
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, uh... there was no beating."
C. Montgomery Burns,What? Well that's a hell of a thing! Why?
Waylon Smithers,Because... I... I called it off.
C. Montgomery Burns,Judas!
Waylon Smithers,"I'm sorry, sir. But I just couldn't hurt Homer Simpson. He saved your life."
C. Montgomery Burns,I see.
Waylon Smithers,"I know you're mad at me, but I think it's only fair to warn you, I'm going to stand outside the gate until you forgive me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No need, Smithers. As usual, you've been the sober ""ying"" to my raging ""yang."" Put 'er there, old pal."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, while I wish this handshake would never end, I'm, I'm afraid we still have the Simpson matter to attend to."
C. Montgomery Burns,"We do indeed, old friend. We do indeed."
,
Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern. Where the elite meet to drink.
Bart Simpson,"Eh, yeah, hello, is Mike there? Last name, Rotch."
Moe Szyslak,"Hold on, I'll check. Mike Rotch. Mike Rotch. Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch, lately?"
Moe Szyslak,"Listen you little puke. One of these days I'm gonna catch you, and I'm gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick."
Moe Szyslak,What's the matter Homer? You're not your normal effervescent self.
Homer Simpson,"I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, hey, you should not drink to forget your problems."
Barney Gumble,"Yeah, you should only drink to enhance your social skills."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"We'll get the Simpsons a present, an extravagant present! A mad, unthinkable, utterly impossible present! A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooo, too practical."
C. Montgomery Burns,Too cutesy-poo.
C. Montgomery Burns,Too cornball.
C. Montgomery Burns,A pool table? Are you mad? I'm not gonna turn his home into a saloon.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Eureka! We've found it!
Waylon Smithers,"B-but, sir... it's thirty-two thousand dollars."
C. Montgomery Burns,Don't you dare sully this moment with your price taggery! It's perfect!
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, woe is me."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, my! It's Mr. Burns."
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Lisa Simpson,"Wait, Dad, he's smiling."
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, you brought us a present."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, what did you think I was going to do -- have you beaten to a bloody pulp?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"To show there's no hard feelings, please take an advance copy of my book, ""Will There Ever Be A Rainbow?"" And now, young fellow, I haven't forgotten you. Here."
Bart Simpson,Wow! A crowbar!
Lisa Simpson,"It's to open the crate, stupid."
Homer Simpson,"What did I tell you? I'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls..."
Bart Simpson,Wow! A big ugly head!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Actually, son, it's a big, ugly Olmec Indian head. It was carved by Meso-American Indians over 3,000 years ago. This gruesome customer is Xt'tapalatakettle, the god of war."
Bart Simpson,Awesome!
Lisa Simpson,"No, Maggie. Not Az-tec. Ol-mec. Ol-mec."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, what does it do?"
Marge Simpson,It doesn't do anything.
Homer Simpson,"Marge! Really, what does it do?"
Marge Simpson,"Whatever it does, it's doing it now."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I'll let you get acquainted with SeÃ±or Xt'tapalatakettle. Ta!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Did you see their faces, Smithers?"
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, you're my god of generosity."
Homer Simpson,"Save a guy's life, and whattaya get? Nothin'! Worse than nothin'! Just a big, scary rock."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, man, don't bad-mouth the head."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, it's the thought that counts. The moral of this story is, ""A good deed is its own reward."""
Bart Simpson,"Hey, we got a reward. The head is cool!"
Marge Simpson,"Well then, I guess the moral is, ""No good deed goes unrewarded."""
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!"
Marge Simpson,"Well... then I guess the moral is, ""The squeaky wheel gets the grease."""
Lisa Simpson,Perhaps there is no moral to this story.
Homer Simpson,Exactly. It's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
Marge Simpson,But it certainly was a memorable few days!
Homer Simpson,Amen to that!
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart... Bart... Hey, Bart."
Bart Simpson,Lisa? It's six a.m. Something's wrong! Dad died!
Lisa Simpson,"No, no. He's fine."
Bart Simpson,"Well, what do you know? I'm relieved."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, my birthday is in two days. I'm gonna be eight years old. It's a big number -- almost double digits."
Bart Simpson,"Well, enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. Your legs start to go... candy doesn't taste as good anymore --"
Bart Simpson,Lisa did it.
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out?"
Bart Simpson,"Sorry, this old timer does ramble on sometimes, don't he?"
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. I've made things for you. But you've lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, we'll forget all..."
Bart Simpson,"Okay, uh-huh. Okay, okay,. Okay, okay, okay okay, it's done! I'm doing it! Birthday gift coming your way!"
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, thank you."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, watch Maggie while I get the laundry."
Bart Simpson,Can do.
Bart Simpson,Hm... Krusty hotline.
Krusty the Clown,"Hi kids! You've reached the Krusty Hotline. If you haven't asked your parents' permission, naughty naughty! But Krusty forgives you! Two dollars for the first minute, fifty cents for each additional minute."
Krusty the Clown,Thanks for calling kids! A new message every day.
Marge Simpson,Maggie!
Marge Simpson,"Bart, I asked you to watch your sister!"
Bart Simpson,I tried to stop her but she overpowered me.
Homer Simpson,Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?
Marge Simpson,I washed it.
Homer Simpson,"Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different."
Marge Simpson,"Now Homer, don't panic. You have plenty of white shirts."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! It's all over, Marge. It's all over."
Marge Simpson,I don't know how this could have happened.
Bart Simpson,"Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle!"
Homer Simpson,You! You did this to me!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please. No one's going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Wait a minute, go back. Zoom in. Why is that man in pink?"
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, that's Homer Simpson, sir. He's one of your boobs from Sector 7-G."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? Well, judging by his outlandish attire, he's some sort of free-thinking anarchist."
Waylon Smithers,"I'll call security, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent. These color monitors have already paid for themselves.
,
Lenny Leonard,"Hey Homer, we saved you a doughnut."
Carl Carlson,It has pink frosting!
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean I'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting --"
Guard #1,Drop that doughnut.
Guard #2,"Let's go, Pinky."
Homer Simpson,You don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...
C. Montgomery Burns,Spare me the tired semantics of the Simpson family! Take him away!
Waylon Smithers,"You know, Mr. Burns, his body cavity search revealed nothing and we must have x-rayed him a hundred times. Maybe he's telling the truth."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Or perhaps you two are in cahoots. Smithers, I seem to recall you had a penchant for bell-bottom trousers back in '79."
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, sir, that was my costume from the plant production of H.M.S. Pinafore."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, yes, of course. Your spirited hornpipe stole the show, as I recall. Now Doctor, what shall we do about our free wheeling fop over here?"
Dr. Marvin Monroe,"Well, Monty, it used to be that establishing a patient's sanity took months. That's all changed, thanks to the ""Marvin Monroe Take Home Personality Test."" Twenty simple questions that will determine just how crazy or meshuggenah, someone is."
Homer Simpson,Print name?
,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. I can't fill this out for you."
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right. I'll get Lisa to do it."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me?"
Bart Simpson,LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY /
Lisa Simpson,"Well, all right -- if you listen to the poem I just wrote."
Homer Simpson,O-kay.
Lisa Simpson,"Meditations on turning eight, by Lisa Simpson. I had a cat named Snowball -- She died, she died! Mom said she was sleeping -- She lied, she lied! Why oh why is my cat dead? Couldn't that Chrysler hit me, instead? I had a hamster named Snuffy -- He died, --"
Homer Simpson,No deal.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, maybe you should do this."
Homer Simpson,"Son, it's no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot?"
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah."
Host,"Our $50,000 Home Video Finalists are: ""Man Breaking Hip."""
Homer Simpson,
Host,Dog on Fire. Ruff! Anybody order a hot dog?
Homer Simpson,Look at him!
Host,"And finally, ""Baby With A Nail Gun."""
Homer Simpson,Awww.
Host,"Okay, it's time to cast your votes now."
Homer Simpson,Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad. ""Do you hear voices?"""
Homer Simpson,"Yes, I'm hearing one right now, while I'm trying to watch TV."
Bart Simpson,"Yes. ""Are you quick to anger?"""
Homer Simpson,Bart! Shut up or I'll shut you up!
Bart Simpson,"Yes. ""Do you wet your pants?"" Well, even the best of us has an occasional accident."
,
Homer Simpson,"So, did I pass?"
C. Montgomery Burns,No.
Waylon Smithers,"Careful, men. He wets his pants."
,
,
Homer Simpson,The devil with his fly open.
Psychiatrist,Right...
Homer Simpson,That's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. They're gonna eat it.
Psychiatrist,Good...
Homer Simpson,Arrghh!
Bart Simpson,HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA /
Class,
Homer Simpson,The boy! This isn't fair! How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?
Psychiatrist,"Well, we have a very simple method."
Psychiatrist,Whoever has that stamp on his hand is insane.
Orderly,Put him in with the big white guy who thinks he's a little black guy.
Homer Simpson,Who are you?
MICHAEL,"Hi. I'm Michael Jackson, from the Jacksons."
Homer Simpson,"I'm Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons."
Michael,I can't believe you've never heard of me. I'm a very popular entertainer.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, of course I've heard of you. I mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was?"
Michael,Michael Jackson.
Homer Simpson,Doesn't ring a bell.
Michael,Thriller?
Homer Simpson,What was that last one?
Michael,Thriller.
Homer Simpson,Nope.
Michael,"Well, how about this? BILLIE JEAN IS NOT MY LOVER / SHE'S JUST A GIRL WHO SAYS THAT I AM THE ONE / BUT THE KID IS NOT MY SON. HEE, HEE, HEE!"
Homer Simpson,Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet?
Michael,The moonwalk?
Homer Simpson,"No, that thing with your feet."
Michael,Here look. Just raise your heel a bit and put a little pressure on the ball of your foot.
Homer Simpson,
Michael,Hee hee hee...
Michael,You seem like a nice guy. Why'd they put you in here?
Homer Simpson,Because I wore a pink shirt.
Michael,I understand. People thought I was crazy for the way I dressed.
Homer Simpson,What'd you wear?
Michael,"One white glove, covered with rhinestones."
Homer Simpson,Bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl--
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, in the split second before he died, I bet Scratchy appreciated his birthday present. You see how this relates to us?"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, you want that once a year empty gesture. You got it, sis."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Michael, I don't get it. These guys seem as normal as you and me."
Michael,"Homer, this is Floyd. He's an idiot savant. Give him any two numbers and he can multiply them in his head, just like that."
Homer Simpson,Okay. Five times nine.
Floyd,Forty-five.
Homer Simpson,Wowww.
Michael,"We call this guy the Chief. He's been here since 1968. Never says a word, never moves a muscle."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Chief."
Chief Wiggum,Hello.
Chief Wiggum,"Well, it's about time somebody reach out to me."
Homer Simpson,"Gee, I gotta call my family."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is so embarrassing, calling 'em from a nut house. I mean, they think I'm a god."
Michael,I could call them for you.
Homer Simpson,"Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight."
,
Bart Simpson,"Joe's Crematorium. You kill 'em, we grill 'em."
Michael,Hello. Who is this?
Bart Simpson,"I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?"
Michael,I'm Michael Jackson.
Bart Simpson,The Michael Jackson? No way!
Michael,"It's true. I'm with your father, in a mental institution."
Bart Simpson,Uh-huh. And is Elvis with you?
Michael,He could be. It's a big hospital.
Bart Simpson,"Aw, come on. If you're really Michael Jackson, who were your last four dates for the Grammys?"
Michael,"Brooke Shields, Diana Ross, Emmanuel Lewis and Bubbles."
Bart Simpson,"Shiver me timbers, you are Michael Jackson. Can you stay on the line while I get all my friends and relatives?"
Michael,"I'm afraid not, Bart. Your father really needs your help. You don't want him to get a lobotomy, do you?"
Bart's Head,"Hmmmm, lobotomy..."
Homer Simpson,"That's all right, son."
Bart Simpson,"Well, there's probably a down-size I don't see. Uh-huh... New Bedlam Asylum... loves us... needs us... fears he may never see us again... Got it... Michael Jackson. Whoo-hoo! I love you, man."
Bart Simpson,"Hey Mom, Dad's in a mental institution."
Marge Simpson,Oh my God! Mother was right.
,
Michael,"Now Homer, don't you worry. Your family's gonna be here before you know it."
Wiseguy,"Forget it, pal, there's only one way out of here and it ain't pretty."
Homer Simpson,What's that?
Wiseguy,Dating a nurse.
,
Marge Simpson,I told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house.
Bart Simpson,"No, mom, you said poor house."
Marge Simpson,I said crazy house!
Bart Simpson,Poor house.
Marge Simpson,Crazy house!
Bart Simpson,Poor house.
Marge Simpson,Crazy house!
Voice On Phone,"Hello, you've reached the New Bedlam ""Wrongly Committed"" Hotline. All of our operators are currently busy. Please stay on the line."
,
Michael,"What's wrong, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,"This place is so strange. Mike, I'm ashamed to admit it to another guy, but I'm... scared."
Michael,We all get scared once in a while. Maybe I can help you.
Michael,"HOMER, THE TWO OF US NEED LOOK NO MORE / WE BOTH FOUND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR / WITH A FRIEND TO CALL MY OWN / I'LL NEVER BE ALONE / AND YOU MY FRIEND WILL SEE / YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME."

Dave,"Okay, so I was working at an insurance company, right? Huh! Youngest VP in the history of the firm. Okay? The job was my life. Then one Monday morning, I got up and I couldn't leave the house. I just couldn't."
Homer Simpson,Was the door locked?
Dave,"No, I just couldn't face what was out there."
Homer Simpson,Was it raining?
Doctor,"No, Homer. Dave suffers from agoraphobia -- a fear of open areas and crowds. Please, Dave, go on."
Dave,"Thank you. Anyway, that day I knew I-I just couldn't make that long drive to work."
Homer Simpson,Were you out of gas?
Homer Simpson,Baby.
Psychiatrist,"Mrs. Simpson, I'm sorry but your husband suffers from a persecution complex, extreme paranoia, and bladder hostility."
Marge Simpson,"Doctor, if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son, Bart, you'd see how sane he is."
Psychiatrist,You mean there really is a Bart? Good Lord!
Homer Simpson,Mmm... pancakes.
Psychiatrist,"Oh, Mr. Simpson, you've got a visitor."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Marge!
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie."
Psychiatrist,"Mr. Simpson, after talking to your wife, we believe you're no threat to yourself or others."
Homer Simpson,"That's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. Could I have it in writing, please?"
Psychiatrist,Of course.
Homer Simpson,Not insane.
Michael,"I'm proud of you, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Thanks a lot, Michael. You really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us."
Michael,"Well, how about today? I'm only here voluntarily."
Homer Simpson,You are? Why?

Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Homer, whatever they've got you on, cut the dose."
Homer Simpson,"Now listen. I'm bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days... Isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! Now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice."
Michael,"Um Homer, I'm a vegetarian. And I don't drink."
Homer Simpson,Are you sure you're here voluntarily?
Michael,"Yes. Now Homer, please make sure he doesn't tell anybody I'm coming."
,
Bart Simpson,"Yes Dad, I solemnly swear I will not tell another living soul... No, not even Milhouse."

Bill,We've just been handed a bulletin from our Rock 'N' Rumor Department.
Marty,"That's right, Michael Jackson -- the Thriller himself -- is moonwalkin' his way right here to our very own Spring- field!"
Bill,"And while we go check it out, why don't you enjoy our seldom heard, extra longggg version of ""In-a-Gadda-da-Vida."""
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Michael Jackson! Oh such a thing happens once in a blue moon. Do I dare to leave my post?
,
Bart Simpson,Aye carumba!
Mayor Joe Quimby,"This is the most exciting thing to happen to our fair town since the uh Dalai Lama visited in 1952. And so, I hereby declare that Route 401, currently known as the Dalai Lama Expressway, will henceforth be known as the Michael Jackson Expressway."
Kent Brockman,"And the guy in the pink shirt is the father of the family who, it turns out, was just released from a mental hospital."
Homer Simpson,Thanks everybody! It's great to be sane.
Homer Simpson,Here he is! Here's the guy you wanna see.
Bart Simpson,Huh?
Homer Simpson,Huh? Huh?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,He's three hundred pounds.
Woman,He's white.
Moe Szyslak,He's dressed without flair.
Mayor Joe Quimby,What the hell made me think Michael Jackson would even visit this jerkwater burg?
Milhouse Van Houten,You owe us Michael Jackson.
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Don't ever show your face around here again, ya tool."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, the entire town is howling for your blood, and before I join them I have one question: Today is my birthday -- you promised to get me something, and... and I'm afraid to ask."
Bart Simpson,"You know, maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask."
Lisa Simpson,"I thought so. Oh, Bart, you..."
Homer Simpson,Come off. I'm sane now.
Lisa Simpson,"Dear Bart, I am using the stationery Mom and Dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only. Perhaps if a professional so advises, I will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion, but rest assured it will be purely for show."
Michael,"Hey, Bart."
Bart Simpson,Hey... you.
Bart Simpson,I WISH YOU BETTER THAN YOUR HEART DESIRE /
Michael,"Bart, when I was a kid, I didn't have much money. So you know what I did when my sisters' birthdays rolled around?"
Bart Simpson,Stiffed 'em?
Michael,No. I wrote them a song. To show that I cared.
Bart Simpson,I can't write a song. I'm only ten.
Michael,Only ten? When I was your age I had six gold records.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Looney Tunes, this is what Michael Jackson looks like. You look like a big fat mental patient."
Michael,You'd be amazed how often I hear that.
Bart Simpson,Just leave me alone.
Michael,"Look boy, either Michael Jackson is some guy working in a recording studio in LA or he's here with you willing to work on this song. It's your choice. So long."
Bart Simpson,"Wait, wait, Michael! You go sit at the piano and I'll boil some coffee."
Bart Simpson,"LISA, HER TEETH ARE BIG AND GREEN / LISA, SHE SMELLS LIKE GASOLINE / LISA, DA DA DA DEESA / SHE IS MY SIS-TA, HER BIRTHDAY I MISSED-TA."
Michael,"Uh, no."
Michael,"Bart, we've got to get to your real feelings about your sister."
Bart Simpson,I don't have any.
Michael,"Well, let's go look at her. Maybe that will help."
Michael,"Ah, she looks sad."
Bart Simpson,That's cause she knows you're looking at her.
Lisa Simpson,"Although I am aware you are looking at me, I would look exactly the same even if you weren't."
Michael,"Bart, think. What happens to you when you turn eight?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, your training wheels come off your bike."
Michael,"Good. That's good. THE TRAINING WHEELS COME OFF YOUR BIKE / YOU START TO NOTICE BOYS YOU LIKE...HEE, HEE, HEE."
Bart Simpson,You're just putting that in because it's commercial.
Bart Simpson,Lisa... Lisa... Lisa.
Lisa Simpson,"Huh... wha-- Bart, it's six a.m."
Bart Simpson,"That's right! Hope you like your present. And a-one, and a-two, and a one, two, three, four --"

Leon Kompowsky,"Well, my work is done here."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Michael. What happened to your voice?"
Leon Kompowsky,"This is my real voice. My name is Leon Kompowski and I'm a brick layer from Patterson, New Jersey. All my life I was very angry until one day I just talked like this. All of a sudden everybody was smiling at me, and I was only doin' good on this earth, so I kept on doin' it. To make a tired point. Which one of us is truly crazy?"
Homer Simpson,Not me. I got this.
Lisa Simpson,"Bye, bye, Leon / Bye, roomie / Bye, Pardner / You're a credit to Dementia!"
Leon Kompowsky,See ya!

Homer Simpson,"Stupid junk mail... ""You May Have Already Won!"" Yeah, win this... ""Here's Good News for Homer Simpsoy""... I'll see that he gets it. How dumb do they think I am?"
Homer Simpson,Huh? A check?
,
,
Teller,"Mr. Simpson, I can assure you this ""check"" of yours is non-negotiable."
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah? Well, what makes you so damn sure?"
Teller,"You see where it says ""VOID-VOID-VOID"" and ""This Is Not A Check""? ""Cash value one twentieth of a cent""? ""Mr. Banker, do not honor."""
Homer Simpson,Shut up.
,
Homer Simpson,I had a feeling it was too good to be true. Every time you get a million dollars something queers the deal.
Lisa Simpson,I don't think real checks have exclamation points.
Marge Simpson,"Well, at least we got a free sample of Reading Digest."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I never read a magazine in my life and I'm not gonna start now."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, a cartoon."
Homer Simpson,"""Well dear, you always wanted a compact."" -- Ain't it the truth."
Marge Simpson,"No, it is not the truth, Homer. It's well documented that women are safer drivers than men."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. Cartoons don't have any deep meaning. They're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh."
,
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, Einstein. Put down your readin', it's lunchtime."
Homer Simpson,"Nah, you go ahead."
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, You don't wanna eat? What'd ya do, get one of them stomach staples?"

,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Who is that bookworm, Smithers?"
Waylon Smithers,"Homer Simpson, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? How very strange. His job description clearly specifies an illiterate."
,
TV Announcer,"We now return to Troy McClure and Delores Montenegro in ""Preacher with a Shovel."""
Troy McClure,"But irrigation can save your people, Chief Smiling Bear."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. God forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds."
Marge Simpson,You've certainly taken a shine to that magazine.
Miss Crowley,Important.
Homer Simpson,"Ooh... How about the ""V""?"
Homer Simpson,"It's not just one magazine, Marge. They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket."
Homer Simpson,Those kids don't know what they're missing.
Lisa Simpson,Daaad!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, what gives, man?"
Homer Simpson,We're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival.
Homer Simpson,Then I heard the sound that all Arctic explorers dread: The pitiless bark of the sea lion. He'll be killed!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article."
Homer Simpson,Don't be so...
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're right."
Marge Simpson,Homie... Put down your magazine for a minute...
Homer Simpson,Hmph?
Marge Simpson,I thought you might want to snuggle.
Homer Simpson,"That reminds me! ""Seven Ways To Spice Up Your Marriage."""
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you have a nice body. And if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask."
Marge Simpson,"Thank you, Homie."
Bart Simpson,"Wow, little meatloaf men!"
Lisa Simpson,"Where did you get the idea for this, Mom?"
Homer Simpson,Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong. And it was free. Free!
Marge Simpson,It certainly has enriched our lives.
Homer Simpson,"Wow! ""Win a Trip to Washington D.C.""! ""All expenses paid... VIP tour""... Oh. It's for kids."
Lisa Simpson,"Wait, Dad!"
Lisa Simpson,"Hm. An essay contest. ""Children under twelve""... ""Three hundred words""... ""Fiercely pro-American."" Sounds interesting."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, maybe this is something you'd like to do, too."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, it's a nice thought, but we both know that this is the pony to bet on."
Lisa Simpson,"What would Ben Franklin say if he were alive today? He'd say... oh, think of a better opening."
Marge Simpson,"How's it going, honey?"
Lisa Simpson,Not very well.
Miss Crowley,Very.
Homer Simpson,Ooh... And Miss? Just one more question --
Marge Simpson,"Well, when I used to get stuck like this, I'd go for a bike ride. Do kids go on bike rides anymore?"
Lisa Simpson,Yes!
Marge Simpson,"I don't know, I thought maybe bikes weren't cool anymore. Do kids still use that word, ""cool""?"
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, Mom."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, America. Inspire me."
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, a bald eagle."
Lisa Simpson,Hmm...
,
Lisa Simpson,"Thanks for driving me to the contest, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Sweetheart, there's nothing I wouldn't do for that magazine."
,
Nelson Muntz,"""So burn the flag if you must. But before you do, you'd better burn a few other things. You better burn your shirt and your pants. Be sure to burn your TV and car.

Lisa Simpson,"When America was born on that hot July day in 1776, the trees in Springfield Forest were tiny saplings, trembling towards the sun. And as they were nourished by Mother Earth, so too did our fledgling nation find strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice. Who would have thought such mighty oaks, or such a powerful nation, could grow out of something so fragile... so pure. Thank you."
Jasper Beardly,What do you think?
Female Judge,It's good. A little too good for an eight-year-old. Methinks I detect the sickly scent of the daddy.
Miss Crowley,Person.
Female Judge,"Mr. Simpson, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your daughter's essay. Lisa, will you excuse us?"
Lisa Simpson,Okay.
Dad,We the purple? What the hell was that?
Female Judge,Are you a professional writer?
Homer Simpson,Uh-uh.
Female Judge,Are you interested in politics or government?
Homer Simpson,
Female Judge,Are you interested in anything?
Homer Simpson,
Female Judge,Could you touch your nose for me?
Female Judge,"Lisa, after meeting your father, I've decided to award you an additional five points. Congratulations. You and your family are going to Washington!"
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Who would've guessed reading and writing would pay off?
,
Flight Attendant,"Yes, sir. Can I get you something?"
Homer Simpson,"Playing cards, notepad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin, propellor-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask and anything else I've got coming to me."
Flight Attendant,I'll see what I can do.
Man #1,Steward!
Flight Attendant,"Little boy, I bet you'd like to visit the cockpit."
Bart Simpson,Oh baby!

Pilot,"And this control stick is like the handlebars on your tricycle. Now, would you like to see where we hang our coats?"

Homer Simpson,Wowww -- A shoehorn! Just like in the movies!
Homer Simpson,"Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, I call first bedsies!"
Lisa Simpson,Bart! There's no such thing as first bedsies. You just made that up.
Bart Simpson,"Well, okay, which one do you want?"
Lisa Simpson,Iiiiiii Waaaaaannt... That one.
Bart Simpson,"Really, you want that one? It's all yours. Whatever you say."
Lisa Simpson,Why? What's wrong with it?

Truong/maria,Hello.

Lobbyist,"Now basically, what we want to do is cut her down."
Arnold,Huh uh.
Lobbyist,"As you can see in our artist's rendition it's full of old growth, just aging and festering away. In comes our logging company... to thin out the clutter. It's all part of nature's, y'know, cycle."
Arnold,"Well Jerry, you're a whale of a Lobbyist And I'd like to give you a logging permit. I would, but uh, this isn't like burying toxic waste. People are gonna notice those trees are gone."
Lobbyist,"Uh, Congressman... this is where it gets awkward, I... I never quite know how to put this... I just want to..."
Arnold,...Offer me a bribe?
Arnold,Ohhh... What is it?
Secretary,It's that little girl from Springfield who wrote the essay. Could be a good photo op.

Arnold,Well hi there! You must be Lisa Simpson.

Lisa Simpson,The Flanders are having a beef-a-thon! Incredible Ned-ibles! Maude-acious vittles!.
Scratchy,
Marge Simpson,I think it means he's having a barbecue.

Homer Simpson,"Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead, Marge, have a ball... What if they game back and I was dead from not eating? They'd cry their eyes out. We should have never gone to the Flanders'. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders' house and leave Homer all alone with no food. And I'd be laughing. Laughing from my grave."

Homer Simpson,That was a joke?
Ned Flanders,"As of Friday, I'm saying toodle-oo to the pharmaceutical game."
Ned Flanders,"No, I kid you not. Here's the noose I had to wear for ten years."
Neighborhood Guy,"What are you going to do, Ned?"
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, like one out of every nine Americans, I'm left-handed. And let me tell you, it ain't all peaches and cream. Your writing gets smeared. Lord help you if you want to drive a standard transmission."

Ned Flanders,"So Homer, I'm dyin' to know. What do you think of the Leftorium?"
Homer Simpson,Uh... Sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.
Ned Flanders,"Well, I know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too."
Homer Simpson,"Fun? Where is this store, Flanders? The merry old land of Oz?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, no. The Springfield Mall."
Maude Flanders,"Oh, here, you two. Make a wish."

Bart Simpson,Six. Seven if there's something good on.
Marge Simpson,Don't you think you should get a little fresh air and maybe some exercise?
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little. It's a boy's best friend."
Marge Simpson,"That's the problem. Even as we speak, millions of children are staring at the TV instead of getting some much-needed exercise. Those children's parents should be ashamed of themselves."

Woman,I am so sorry. How much do I owe you?
Ned Flanders,"Now, you put that money away. That was an accident."
Woman,"Really? Well, thanks. Could you validate my parking?"
Ned Flanders,Absotively posilutely.
Homer Simpson,"So, Flanders, have you sold anything?"
Ned Flanders,N-Not yet. But one of the mall security guards took a good long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop.

Akira,"Greetings. I am Akira, your guide on the path to true karate. And this is our map, the Art of War by Sun Tzu. It will teach us our most important lesson: we learn karate so that we need never use it."

Akira,"Ah, yes, the impetuousness of youth! For now, let us read."
Bart Simpson,"Akira, my good man. When do we break blocks of ice with our heads?"
Akira,First you must fill your head with wisdom. Then you can hit ice with it.
Bart Simpson,"Yo, sensei, can I go to the bathroom?"
Akira,"You can, if you believe you can."
Bart Simpson,Paying money to read books... the hell with this.

Bart Simpson,"Come on, Touch of death. Touch of death. Touch of death."
Video Voice,Touch of death!

Homer Simpson,"I'm telling you, Flanders' store was dee-serted. So what do you think of your bestest buddy now, Marge?"
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, do you know what Schadenfreude is?"
Homer Simpson,"No, I do not know what Schadenfreude is. Please tell me, because I'm dying to know."
Lisa Simpson,"It's the German term for ""shameful joy"" -- taking pleasure in the suffering of others."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on, Lisa. I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. He's usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... What's the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours?"
Lisa Simpson,Sour grapes.
Homer Simpson,"Boy, those Germans have a word for everything."
Marge Simpson,"So Bart, what did you learn in karate school today?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks."
Bart Simpson,"Uh, I learned the touch of death."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, the touch of death."
Bart Simpson,"Permit me to demonstrate. Lisa, shut your eyes. Soon you will be at peace."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it! Hey, quit it, quit it, quit it! M-o-o-o-m!"
Marge Simpson,"Bart, don't use the touch of death on your sister."
,
Bart Simpson,Uh-oh. Gotta get back to karate class.
Bart Simpson,You missed a spot.
Bart Simpson,"All right. Comin' through. Outta my way. Move it along. Step aside, lady."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, boy. How was class?"
Bart Simpson,Today we learned how to rip a man's heart out and show it to him before he dies.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that'll learn 'im."
,
Jimbo Jones,What'd ya swipe?
DOLPH,"An ""I Love Lefties"" shot glass."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Left-handed pinking shears.
Jimbo Jones,Pinking shears? Let's go to the Food Court and steal some baked potatoes.
Homer Simpson,"Hey Flanders, when are your busy hours?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, oh, oh, I expect things to start picking up soon. I think word of mouth is startin' to spread."
Man Shopper,"Hey, I hear you validate parking tickets without purchase."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, right as rain. Or, as we say around here, left as rain."
Man Shopper,Just stamp the ticket.
Ned Flanders,"Uh, okay."
,
Barney Gumble,"Hey Homer, how's your neighbor's store doing?"
Homer Simpson,Lousy. He just sits there all day. He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.
Moe Szyslak,Crummy right-handed corkscrews! What does he sell?
Homer Simpson,"Uh, well actually, Moe..."
HOMER (CONT'D,I dunno.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lis. Change the channel."
Lisa Simpson,You change it.
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, okay."
Bart Simpson,I grow weary of this new channel. Change it back.
Lisa Simpson,But Bart --

Homer Simpson,"Apple, apple, apple... Come on candy bar. Hey, I know you! You're that first apple I didn't want. That sinks it. I'm really gonna let 'em have it this time!"

Waylon Smithers,"Simpson, put that box on Mr. Burns' desk. Chop, chop!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah! Look, Smithers, another member of our nuclear family, with some helpful suggestions. And what's your name?"
Homer Simpson,"Homer Simpson, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? Hmm hmmm. I'm Monty Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hm. ""Keep that handsome owner out of sight. He's distracting the female employees."" Smithers..."
Waylon Smithers,"Got me, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh! It's a real one! ""No more apples in the vending machine, please."" Well, that's almost a sentence!"
Homer Simpson,"Can I leave, Mr. Burns?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, of course. And don't worry, there'll be plenty of apples for you. Nobody will take away your precious apples."
Homer Simpson,But the note was asking you to --
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, now, now. Tell my secretary I said you could have a free apple. She'll make everything all right, I promise."
C. Montgomery Burns,Damned infernal gizmo. My kingdom for a left-handed can opener!
Homer Simpson,"Um, Mr. Burns..."
Ned Flanders,"Come on, Homer. Tell him about the store. I'm dyin' out here."
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Flanders."
,
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Ned Flanders,Are you sure you're not interested? Two hundred dollars is only the asking price.
Man,"Sorry, Ned."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, I'm flexible! You don't have to pay all at once. I'll be here all night if you change your mind."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders. Is everything okay?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, yeah. Sure. Thought I'd just get rid of some of the clutter. See anything you like?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I get it. It's not good enough for you, but it's good enough for me! Well, I wouldn't be caught dead buying this... Hello!"
Ned Flanders,"Ah, got your eye on the gas grill. She's a butane beaut."
Homer Simpson,I'll give you twenty bucks for it.
Ned Flanders,"Twenty? Homer, I paid three hundred dollars for this just last year."
Homer Simpson,"You were swindled, my friend. Twenty bucks. Take it or leave it."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Homer, be reasonable."
Homer Simpson,Sorry! No cash for Neddie! Homer keep all money! Bye bye Neddie! Bye bye!
Ned Flanders,"All right, Homer."
Homer Simpson,Twenty dollars?
Ned Flanders,Twenty dollars.
Homer Simpson,Now I don't want it.
Ned Flanders,What?
Homer Simpson,"I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney?"
Bart Simpson,"Sounds scrump-didly-umptious, dear old Daddly-doodly."
Homer Simpson,Daddly-doodly.
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, this is the Flanders' entire living room set. How much did you pay for this?"
Homer Simpson,Only seventy-five beans!
Marge Simpson,Seventy-five dollars? Ned must be desperate!
Lisa Simpson,"I'm sure you did nothing to discourage this, you scavenger of human misery."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, keep your hands off my china hutch."
Collection Agent,"Good afternoon, sir, I'm Chuck Ellis from the Springfield Collection Agency, and I'm here to ask you why you don't think you need to pay your bills."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I know I need to pay them. But there's just so many."
Collection Agent,"Does it make you feel good about yourself to owe people money? We've been very patient with you, Mr. Flanders."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"I know, but... Wait a minute. I'm Homer Simpson. Ned Flanders lives over there."
Collection Agent,Oh.
Homer Simpson,Flanders is in debt? Are you sure?
Collection Agent,We don't make mistakes.
Collection Agent,Damn right-handed ledgers... can't write in these things...

Lisa Simpson,Hey!!
DOLPH,"Hey, look at me -- I'm Elvis, man."
Lisa Simpson,You give that back. That belongs to me! That's mine!
DOLPH,"If you want it, just take it."
DOLPH,Okay. We're sorry. This time we're really gonna give it to you.
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, stop that."
Bart Simpson,"Hey Lis, something wrong?"
Lisa Simpson,Not any more. You punks are about to get a taste of your own medicine. This is my brother... and he knows Karate.
Bart Simpson,Uh oh.
DOLPH,"Oh, we're real scared."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Please don't hurt us, Bart!"
Jimbo Jones,"What are you gonna do, throw your diapers at us?"
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, just keep laughing, it only makes him madder. Come on, Bart, start them off with the touch of death and go from there."
Bart Simpson,"I think they've learned their lesson already, Lis."
DOLPH,"No, we want to see the touch of death."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Yeah, come on Karate kid. Waste me!"
Lisa Simpson,It's funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right.
,
Ned Flanders,Homer! Over here!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Flanders, I, uh, want to give you your stuff back."
Ned Flanders,"Well, there's no house to put it in, Homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up."
Homer Simpson,You're gonna live in your car?
Ned Flanders,"Oh, oh, no, it's just a little campout tonight, then off to my sister's apartment in Capital City. Hey what do think, kids? The big city!"

Ned Flanders,"Listen to that singing... those poor fools. Homer, I'm ruined."
Homer Simpson,I know!
Ned Flanders,"You know at times like these, I-I used to turn to the Bible and find solace. But even the good book can't help me now."
Homer Simpson,Why not?
Ned Flanders,I sold it to you for seven cents.
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Ned Flanders,"You know, ever since that barbecue, nothing's gone right. It's like there's been a-a curse on me."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's all my fault."
Ned Flanders,No it's not.
Homer Simpson,Yes it is.
Ned Flanders,"No! You tried to warn me about gambling my family's future on some pig in a poke... I didn't listen. Homer, you were a true friend."
Homer Simpson,"No, I was a swine."
Homer Simpson,"Listen, Flanders, do you still have that store?"
Ned Flanders,For two more days. Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters. I hope they have better luck than I did.
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, you open that store tomorrow!"
Bear,
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Homer, there's no point..."
Homer Simpson,I SAID DO IT!
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Jerry? Homer Simpson. Remember last month, when I paid back that loan? Well, now I need you to do a favor for me."
Moe Szyslak,"A left-handed corkscrew? Oh, baby!"
Barney Gumble,"""Kiss Me, I'm Left-Handed""? That's a classic!"

Bart Simpson,Good mornin' world!
Bart Simpson,Ow!
,
Bart Simpson,Good morning Lisa!
Lisa Simpson,What are you so happy about?
Bart Simpson,"Why shouldn't I be happy? It's a beautiful day, my homework is done, I've got my mojo workin' and we're goin' on a field trip this afternoon."
Bart Simpson,And... looks like I got me a genuine glow-in-the-dark police badge.
Bart Simpson,Hey! It's not in here. You stole it!
Lisa Simpson,"No one wants your stupid police badge, Bart."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, look what I got. A genuine official police badge... Calling all cars... come out with your hands up!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, that's my badge, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"That's Officer Homer. Heh heh, heh, heh."
,
Bart Simpson,... Lousy prize-grabbing... badge-wearing...
Bart Simpson,You ate my homework?
Bart Simpson,I didn't know dogs really did that.

Bart Simpson,Wait! Wait!

,
Bart Simpson,
,
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Bart Simpson! You're late! Go fill out a tardy slip.
Bart Simpson,But I'm only... ... ... five... ten... twenty... forty minutes? That's pretty damn late.
,
Bart Simpson,Hey girls! Look at me!
Bart Simpson,You can stop lookin' at me now.
Bart Simpson,
,
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Well, it's nearly one o'clock. And you know what that means."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,My glasses.
,
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,That's right. It's time for our field trip to the chocolate factory. I trust you all remembered to bring your permission slips.
Bart Simpson,
,
,
Bart Simpson,What a day.
,
Lisa Simpson,I'm gonna eat EIGHT pieces of chocolate.
Ralph Wiggum,I'm gonna eat chocolate till I barf.
,
Seymour Skinner,"Don't worry, Bart, we'll find something fun for you to do."
Seymour Skinner,Ah! Here we are! Here's a whole box of unsealed envelopes for the PTA.
Bart Simpson,You're making me lick envelopes?
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, licking envelopes can be fun! All you have to do is make a game of it."
Bart Simpson,What kind of game?
Seymour Skinner,"Well... for example... you could see how many you can lick in an hour, and then try to break that record."
Bart Simpson,Sounds like a pretty crappy game to me.
Seymour Skinner,Yes... well... get started.
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Oh my God. It's Cocoa Beanie himself.
Lisa Simpson,I think this is something Bart would really have enjoyed. But it's the only way he'll learn.
,
Troy McClure,"Welcome to the chocolate factory. I'm Troy McClure. You probably remember me from such films as ""The Revenge of Abe Lincoln"" and ""The Wackiest Covered Wagon in the West."" The history of chocolate starts with the ancient Aztecs."
Troy McClure,"In those days, instead of being wrapped in a hygienic package, chocolate was wrapped in a tobacco leaf."
Troy McClure,"And instead of being pure chocolate like we have today, it was mixed with shredded tobacco. And they didn't eat it. They smoked it."
,
Seymour Skinner,"You didn't believe me when I said it would be fun, did you?"
Bart Simpson,No thir.
Bart Simpson,
Executive,"Please, kids, play sanitary."
,
Bart Simpson,Tan Die Doe Dow?
Seymour Skinner,What?
Bart Simpson,Tan... Die.... Doe... Dow.
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm... Well there's still a minute to go... oh, why not! But don't you tell your teacher I let you go home early."
Bart Simpson,Die don't.
,
,
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,What next?
Bart Simpson,Uh-oh.
,
Fat Tony,"Hey, what's with the kid?"
Bart Simpson,Hands off the material!
Legs,Whaddaya know! The kid's tough.
Louie,He's got spunk.
Fat Tony,"I wonder if he is lucky also. Pick a horse, kid. Shelbyville Downs. Third race. Make it a good one."
Bart Simpson,Eat my shorts.
Fat Tony,"Eat my shorts. Ah, okay. Let's see... Heyy... Wait a minute, you little punk! Eat My Shorts is in the fifth race. I said the third race!"
Bart Simpson,Don't have a cow.
Fat Tony,"Hmm... ""Don't have a cow"" in the third. Put a deuce on him."
Fat Tony,"While we are waiting to see how lucky you are, let me show you around. This is our bar, and over there is our slot machine and card tables...."
Bart Simpson,Cool!
Joey,Hey Boss! Here's the call for the third race.
Race Announcer,"...As they come out of the turn it's ""Sufferin Succotash"" by a neck over ""Yabbadabbadoo."" Two lengths back to ""Ain't I a Stinker"" and ""That's All Folks."" ""I Yam What I Yam"" can see them all. But here comes ""Donhavacow"" flyin' on the outside. And at the wire it's all ""Donhavacow!"""
Fat Tony,"Hey, I like this kid. I can't believe we were gonna shoot him. Can you mix drinks?"
Bart Simpson,I don't know.
Legs,I'll have a Manhattan.
Fat Tony,Make Legs a Manhattan.
Bart Simpson,I'm not sure I...
Fat Tony,Well?
Legs,Supoib.
,
Marge Simpson,You got a job? Doing what?
Bart Simpson,"Oh... I dunno... mixing drinks, picking horses, cuttin' cigars... you know -- a job."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, your father and I don't want you doing that. Homer, say something."
Homer Simpson,How much does it pay?
Bart Simpson,Thirty bucks a week.
Homer Simpson,Pfft. I make more than that.
Bart Simpson,"I was lookin' for those. Thanks, doll."
Marge Simpson,
Fat Tony,It's funny because it's true.
Legs,Well obsoived.
Fat Tony,"Chief Wiggum, you honor us with your presence."
Chief Wiggum,Baloney. I'm not gonna rest until one of us is behind bars -- You! You wouldn't happen to know anything about a cigarette truck that got hijacked on route 401?
Fat Tony,What's a truck?
Chief Wiggum,Don't play dumb with me!
Fat Tony,"Relax Chief, you seem tense. You know, the boy here makes an excellent Manhattan."
Chief Wiggum,"Ah... I'm still gonna put you away, you know."
Fat Tony,"Good for you, Chief."
Homer Simpson,... Bart! Have you started smoking?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Don't lie to me boy.
Homer Simpson,"Aha! Cigarettes, just as I thought."
Bart Simpson,They're not mine. My boss said his warehouse was full.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, right. Son... I'm gonna teach you a lesson. I'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you'll learn..."
Delivery Man,Uh... Fat Tony sent me over to pick up the goods.
Bart Simpson,Right in here my man.
Delivery Man,"Hey kid, you look good with that cigarette. Kind of sophisticated."
Homer Simpson,"Son, I'll never doubt you again."
Kent Brockman,The contents of the hijacked truck: some twelve thousand cartons of Laramie 100's.
Marge Simpson,Homer? Homer!
Chief Wiggum,"We have... uh... Please, we have a number of leads. And let me assure all you smokers out there... there is no shortage of cigarettes."
Reporter,How do we know that?
Chief Wiggum,"All right, let me refer that question back to Jack Larson, of Laramie Tobacco Products. Jack?"
Jack Larson,"Thank you Chief. Folks, I'm pleased to announce that a new truckload of Laramies with their smooth good taste and rich tobacco flavor is already heading towards Springfield. And the driver has been instructed to ignore all stop signs and crosswalks."
Kent Brockman,"The police suspect the involvement of reputed mobster William ""Fat Tony"" Williams."
Chief Wiggum,Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city. He is the cancer and I am the... uh... ... what cures cancer?
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, is your boss a crook?"
Bart Simpson,I don't think so. Although it would explain an awful lot.
,
Fat Tony,Me and the boys wish to thank you for hanging onto this stuff for us.
Bart Simpson,"Thanks... uh... Say, are you guys crooks?"
Fat Tony,"Bart, um... is it wrong to steal a loaf of bread to feed your starving family?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Fat Tony,"Well, suppose you got a large starving family. Is it wrong to steal a truckload of bread to feed them?"
Bart Simpson,Uh-uh.
Fat Tony,"And what if your family don't like bread, they like cigarettes?"
Bart Simpson,I guess that's okay.
Fat Tony,"Now, what if instead of giving them away, you sold them at a price that was practically giving them away. Would that be a crime, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,Hell no!
Fat Tony,Enjoy your gift.
Bart Simpson,Supoib.

Bart Simpson,"THOSE FINGERS THROUGH MY HAIR / THAT SLY COME HITHER STARE / THAT STRIPS MY CONSCIENCE BARE / IT'S WITCHCRAFT - GIMME THREE FINGERS OF MILK, MA."
Marge Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"I know it's good for a boy to have a part-time job, but I'm not sure about the people Bart's working for. I thinks they're criminals."
Fat Tony,The kiss of death. That's all I need!
Homer Simpson,"A job's a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal."
Marge Simpson,"Well, Bart's been acting very strangely. And that pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for two weeks."
Marge Simpson,How long does it take to deliver a pizza?
,
Fbi Agent #1,Looks like our cover's blown.
Fbi Agent #2,Let's roll.
,
Homer Simpson,See? It was all your imagination.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I want you to go down to that club and talk to them. Just see what kind of people they are. Please, Homie?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all right."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hee hee, hee-hee-hee! Read 'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes."
Fat Tony,Beats me.
Joey,I was bluffin'.
Legs,"You win again, Homer."
Homer Simpson,
Fat Tony,I am thrilled you've decided to let your boy continue to work here.
Homer Simpson,"You know if you need a hat check girl, I've got a daughter."
Fat Tony,"Homer, you're a hellava father."
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, what did you find out?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding."
,
Bart Simpson,"More ""stink lines"" boys."
Seymour Skinner,What's this? What are you boys doing?
Bart Simpson,You ain't seen nothin'. Now beat it.
,
Rival Gang Leader,"So, Fat Tony. You invite me and my associates to your club with the promise of the finest Manhattans in all of Springfield. Now you say your bartender isn't here?"
Fat Tony,I don't know what happened. He's never late. Louie! Make up some Manhattans.
Louie,But I only know how to make wine spritzers.
Fat Tony,Now!
Rival Gang Leader,"What have I done to deserve this flat, flavorless Manhattan?"
Rival Gang Leader,"Come on, boys."
Bart Simpson,Lousy Skinner.
Fat Tony,You are late for work.
Bart Simpson,Of course I'm late for work. How can I be on time when Principal Skinner keeps me after school?
Fat Tony,This guy Skinner causing you trouble?
Bart Simpson,"He sure is, Patrone."
Fat Tony,"Hm... perhaps we should go to meet and greet this individual. Come on, boys."
,
Secretary,"Some large men to see you, sir."
Seymour Skinner,I don't have an appointment with any large men --
Fat Tony,You Skinner?
Seymour Skinner,"I'm PRINCIPAL Skinner, yes. And how, may I ask, did you get past the hall monitors?"
,
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Children, I don't know how to break this to you, but Principal Skinner is... ... MISSING!"
Bart Simpson,Uh-oh.
,
,
Groundskeeper Willie,I thought I found him but it was only a cat.
,
,
Chief Wiggum,"Now please... Please, please, I can assure you we'll be using the most advanced, scientific techniques in the field of... body finding."
Psychic,I see wedding bells for Vanna White and Teddy Kennedy....
Chief Wiggum,"Please, Princess Opal, if we could just stick to Principal Skinner."
Psychic,"Chief Wiggum, I am merely a conduit for the spirits. Willie Nelson will astound his fans by swimming the English Channel."
Chief Wiggum,Really? Willie Nelson?
,
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,He loved fire drills.
Groundskeeper Willie,"Will ya get a hold of yourself, Lass, for the wee bairns!"
,
Lewis Clark,Hey look at me! I'm Skinner's body!
Bart Simpson,"That is not funny, Lewis."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, I heard Skinner's buried under his parking spot."
Richard,I heard he was ground up into hamburger and served to us at lunch.
Nelson Muntz,I heard Bart had Skinner killed by gangsters.
Bart Simpson,That's not true! It's just a rumor! You're engaged in speculation. I know the law. You can't prove anything.
,
Skinner Body,You killed me Bart.
Bart Simpson,
Skinner Body,"You killed me, Bart!"
Bart Simpson,
Skinner Body,"You k-killed me, Bart!"
Bart Simpson,

Bart Simpson,Reverend Lovejoy! You've... you've come to comfort me?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Yes, Bart. ... There there... there there..."

Homer Simpson,Kill my boy! Kill my boy!
,
,
,
Fat Tony,You're eight hours early for work. I like that.
Bart Simpson,Did you kill my principal?
Fat Tony,Uh... Chinese guy with a mustache?
Bart Simpson,No! My principal!
Legs,"That Skinner guy? Naw, we didn't kill him."
Chief Wiggum,Nobody move! You're all under arrest for the murder of Seymour Skinner.
Fat Tony,What's a murder?
Chief Wiggum,"Don't play dumb with me. Cuff 'em, boys."
,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Bart. Why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys."
Homer Simpson,"Wait till I get you home, boy."
Bart Simpson,What's that guy doing here?
Lionel Hutz,"Lionel Hutz, court-appointed attorney. I'll be defending you on the charge of -- Murder one?! Wow, even if I lose I'll be famous!"
,
Waylon Smithers,That Simpson boy is looking at a hundred and eighty years.
Fat Tony,"Yeah, you're right."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Thank God we live in a country so hysterical over crime that a ten-year-old child can be tried as an adult.
,
Fat Tony,I didn't order this Skinner guy killed.
Blue-Haired Lawyer,But aren't you the head of this gang?
Fat Tony,"No, I just stop by the club occasionally to read the complimentary newspaper."
Blue-Haired Lawyer,Then who is the Kingpin... the Capo de tuti Capi?
Fat Tony,That's the guy.
Bart Simpson,Hey!
Fat Tony,"Forgive me, Don Bartholomew."
Louie,"We tried to stop the kid, but he wouldn't quit. It was like he went crazy."
Legs,"Prostitution, loan sharking, numbers. The kid liked to wet his beak in everything."
Lionel Hutz,"Mr. Simpson, you've been the boy's father for ten years. Do you really think he could be the leader of a murderous criminal syndicate?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, not the leader... I mean... Oh, it's true, it's true! All the pieces fit."
Judge Snyder,"In light of the damning testimony from your fellow gangsters, your father, your teachers and a seemingly endless parade of emotionally shattered baby-sitters, this court has no choice but to..."
Seymour Skinner,Stop!
Marge Simpson,Principal Skinner!
Homer Simpson,I thought he was dead.
Seymour Skinner,"I suppose you're all wondering where I've been. It all started a week ago. I was at my desk, revising and updating the school dress codes, when..."
,
Seymour Skinner,I was suddenly confronted by a gang of toughs acting on behalf of one Bart Simpson. Or so they said.
Louie,We really think there's promise in the boy.
Seymour Skinner,Get out!
Fat Tony,"Okay, okay, you don't have to yell."
,
Seymour Skinner,To get my mind off that ugly confrontation I went home and began bundling my old newspapers. But suddenly the pile fell. I was trapped. Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently.
Homer Simpson,"Eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple."
,
Juvies,
Seymour Skinner,"For the next week I stayed alive by eating my mother's delicious preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball with my one free hand. I made a game of it, seeing how many times I could bounce the ball in a day, then trying to break that record. Occasionally the police arrived to search my home."
,
Chief Wiggum,"Find anything this time, boys?"
Lou,"Nah... no sign of him, chief."
Chief Wiggum,Princess Opal?
Psychic,I see nothing here but I'm afraid it's splitsville for Delta Burke and Major Dad.
Chief Wiggum,But they seemed so happy.
Seymour Skinner,"I shouted until I was hoarse, but they couldn't hear me."
,
Seymour Skinner,I'M IN HERE!!!
Chief Wiggum,"Well, let's go."
Eddie,"Okay, Chief."
Seymour Skinner,"Finally I realized if I was ever going to get out of there, I would have to do it myself."
Seymour Skinner,"I formed a crude rocket from a discarded cigar tube. And remembering an experiment from my days as a fourth grade science teacher, I concocted a fuel from baking soda and the juice of discarded lemon wedges."
Seymour Skinner,"The rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide, dragging behind it the end of a vacuum cleaner cord."
Seymour Skinner,"I grabbed on to the vacuum cleaner, pushed the cord retractor button and was on my way to freedom."
,
Seymour Skinner,And that's my courageous story.
Prosecuting Attorney,"Your Honor, the prosecution moves that Principal Skinner's testimony be stricken from the record."
Judge Snyder,Denied. Case dismissed.
Lionel Hutz,"Your Honor, do I still get paid?"
,
Fat Tony,Hey Bart! I hope there are no hard feelings.
Bart Simpson,Get bent.
Fat Tony,"I deserved that. Look, I know we let you down, but me and the boys, we still think you've got a big future in racketeering and extortion."
Bart Simpson,"Sorry Fat Tony. I used to think your gang was cool, but now I learned that crime doesn't pay."
,
Announcer,"Blood on the Blackboard: The Bart Simpson Story. Starring Richard Chamberlain as Principal Skinner, Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony, Jane Seymour as the woman he loved, and TV's Doogie Howser, Neil Patrick Harris as Bart Simpson."
Joe,"Bart, I'm scared. Let's get outta here."
Neil,Shaddup!
Neil,"Where do you want it, Skinner?"
Neil,Not smart.
Bart Simpson,Cool!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, when do we get the check for this?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us."
Homer Simpson,You know who the real crooks are? Those sleazy Hollywood Producers.
,
Homer Simpson,"Here's good news. According to this eye-catching article, SAT scores are declining at a slower rate."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and Larry King."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this is the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine."
Bart Simpson,"""To me bestest bud Milhouse, Happy Birthday, Bart."""
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, that's so sweet. May I see the card?"
Lisa Simpson,Hey there ten-year old. I couldn't afford to get you a new drum...
Lisa Simpson,...so how about a nice pair of bongos? Ewww.
,
Bart Simpson,"C'mon, open it open it open it."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Uh, maybe a little later, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Aw Milhouse, just cuz your mom didn't let you have a party doesn't mean you can't get a present."
Sherri Mackleberry,"We had a lovely time on Saturday, Milhouse."
Terri Mackleberry,I liked the balloons.
Sherri Mackleberry,I liked the party hats.
Bart Simpson,What are you girls talkin' about?
Terri Mackleberry,Nothing.
Bart Simpson,Twins. Open your present.
Bart Simpson,"They're official Krusty the Clown walkie-talkies. I'll keep one and you keep one. Now whenever you want to talk to me, just call me on the phone and tell me to turn on my walkie-talkie."
Martin Prince,"Milhouse, I'd like to express my appreciation for Saturday. Jelly bean baskets, personalized noisemakers -- those little touches are what made it enduring."
Bart Simpson,What's he talkin' about?
Milhouse Van Houten,"Uh... hey, look at that dog. Isn't that somethin'?"
Bart Simpson,"Wow, brown!"
Otto Mann,"Whoa, Springfield Elementary, last stop. Oh, and by the way, I'd like to say thanks, and 'applause, applause' to 'birthday boy' Milhouse for his totally bitchin' party on Saturday."
Otto Mann,"And uh, Milhouse, I think I left my pants on your roof."
Bart Simpson,You did have a party. You didn't invite me. And I thought we were best friends.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Sorry, Bart."
Otto Mann,Bye little dudes. Don't learn anything I wouldn't learn.

C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Monday morning. Time to pay for your two days of debauchery, you hung-over drones."
Waylon Smithers,"T.G.I.M., Sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yeah. so, what did you do this weekend, Smithers?"
Waylon Smithers,"Well, I caught up on my laundry. And wrote a letter to mother. Oh, here's the kicker, I took Hercules out to be clipped."
C. Montgomery Burns,Who the devil is Hercules?
Waylon Smithers,"He's my Yorkshire terrier, sir. He's kind of tiny, so... you know, it's a joke. Here's a picture of Herkie."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Smithers, don't you know how to paint the town red."
Waylon Smithers,May I ask how you spent your weekend?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, a bit overly familiar, but I'll allow it. I took in a movie. An appalling little piece of filth. Its leading lady was a blonde harlot who spent half the film strolling around naked as a jaybird."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they'll 'oink' for more every time."
Homer Simpson,What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets.
Lenny Leonard,Sounds like my kind of flick.
Carl Carlson,And how.
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Otto! Welcome!
Otto Mann,"Apu! Hey, got a ba-ad case of the munchies, man. Time for a Heat-lamp Dog."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, Otto. Otto, did you know there's a small child inside your bus?"
Otto Mann,"Ooo, good thing you warned me. I was on my way to Mexico."

C. Montgomery Burns,"Call me old-fashioned, but movies were sexier when the actors kept their clothes on. Vilma Banky could do more for me with one raised eyebrow than an entire..."
Calm Woman,Warning. Problem in sector 7-G.
C. Montgomery Burns,"7-G? Good God, who's the safety inspector there?"
Waylon Smithers,"Homer Simpson, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? Good man? Intelligent?"
Waylon Smithers,"Actually sir, he was hired under ""Project Bootstrap."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Thank you, President Ford."
,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Noise. Bad noise!
Calm Woman,Five minutes before critical mass.
Homer Simpson,"Critical wha...? Okay, okay, don't panic. Whosever problem this is, I'm sure they know how to handle it."
Homer Simpson,Huh? AHHH!! It's my problem! We're doomed!!!
Calm Woman,Sector 7-G is now being isolated.
,
Bart Simpson,"My best friend shafted me. I'll never get over this, Otto-man."
Otto Mann,"Aw, sure you will. You know, once my old lady ran off and married my brother. Well, it hurt, but here it is a month later and I'm sleeping on their couch."

Mr. Devereaux,"Margarita, I want you."
Margarita,"Mr. Devereaux, I can't work under these conditions."

Announcer,Meltdown crisis: The first couple of minutes.
Singers,K-B-B-L. Talk radio.
Kent Brockman,"Forget the hair, just give me the blush. Oh, we're on."
Kent Brockman,This station has just learned that a serious crisis is in progress at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.
Marge Simpson,Oh my Lord!
Kent Brockman,On the line with us now is plant owner C. Montgomery Burns. Mr. Burns?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh hello, Kent. Right now, skilled nuclear energy technicians are calmly correcting a minor, piffling malfunction."
,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"But, I can assure you and the public that there is absolutely no danger whatsoever --"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,-- things couldn't be more ship-shape.
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, where's my radiation suit?"
C. Montgomery Burns,How the hell should I know?
,
Kent Brockman,"Uh, Mr. Burns, people are calling this a meltdown."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, meltdown is one of those annoying buzzwords. I prefer to call it an unrequested fission surplus."
Marge Simpson,"Homie, please be all right."
,
Homer Simpson,"Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there's a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT."
,
Homer Simpson,Who'd have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated!
,
Calm Woman,Ninety seconds to core meltdown.
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, there may never be another time to say... I love you, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, hot dog. Thank you for making my last few moments on earth socially awkward."
,
Moe Szyslak,Looks like this is the end.
Barney Gumble,That's all right. I couldn't have led a richer life.
,
Kent Brockman,After the meltdown we can expect roving bands of thieves to tie up traffic for ours.
Grampa Simpson,I don't like this program.
Jasper Beardly,Change the channel.
Program Voices,Wheel of Fortune!
,
Homer Simpson,"I don't understand anything! When they look up stupid in the dictionary, there'll be a picture of me!"
,
Marge Simpson,"Dear Lord, if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground, I'll try to be a better Christian. I don't know what I can do... Ummm, oooh, the next time there's a canned food drive I'll give the poor something they'd actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix."
,
Calm Woman,One minute to core meltdown.
Homer Simpson,Shut up!
Homer Simpson,"Simpson, it's all up to you. It's showtime!"
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, think back to your training..."
,
Instructor,"Now Homer, this may very well save your life one day. This, Homer..."
Homer Simpson,Yes.
Instructor,"Please pay attention. This button here controls the emergency override circuit. In the event of a meltdown, push this button and only this button."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a side."
Instructor,Simpson?
Homer Simpson,What?
Instructor,Do you see which button I'm pushing?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it."
Homer Simpson,"This is all your fault! Okay, gotta pick a button. Pick a button. Pick a button. Uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... No, wait! Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? No, no!"
,
Calm Woman,Thirty seconds to core meltdown.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, Smithers, I guess there's nothing left but to kiss my sorry butt good-bye!"
Waylon Smithers,"May I, sir?"
C. Montgomery Burns,
,
Professor Jonathan Frink,"These unfortunate people here will be instantly killed. This circle, which I am sad to say we are in, will experience a slower, considerably more painful death."
Kent Brockman,Good Lord.
,
Seymour Skinner,They called me old-fashioned for teaching the duck and cover. But who's laughing now?
,
Calm Woman,Fifteen seconds to core meltdown.
Homer Simpson,"Eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... Eenie meenie minee... Moe."
Calm Woman,All systems returning to normal. Danger in 7-G neutralized. Have a nice day.
,
Female Worker,Will I ever see you again?
Male Worker,"Sure, baby. Next meltdown."
,
Contestant,"I'd like to solve the puzzle: ""Three loins in the fountain."""
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, we've isolated the problem and wouldn't you know? False alarm. It seems a single wayward crow flew into our warning system."
Kent Brockman,"Very good. Well sir, your point about nuclear hysteria is well taken. This reporter promises to be more trusting and less vigilant in the future."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. Well, ""ta"". Hmmm, Smithers, I can still sell 'em snake oil. Now bring me a wine spritzer -- and don't be stingy with the vino."
Waylon Smithers,Yes sir.
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, Smithers, it seems you've underestimated one Homer Simpson... our next Employee-of-the-Month."
,
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, a little salt?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Sure.
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, my mom won't let me be your friend anymore. That's why you couldn't come to the party."
Bart Simpson,What's she got against me?
Milhouse Van Houten,She says you're a bad influence.
Bart Simpson,"Bad influence my ass! How many times have I told you, never listen to your mother!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"But Bart, she threatened to cut off my allowance."
Bart Simpson,"Whatever she's paying you, I'll double it."
Milhouse Van Houten,"I'm really sorry, Bart."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, about Employee-of-the-Month... I-I-if you'll recall, I'm the one who put a five percent ceiling on the Keogh Plan, which saved this company --"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, you bean counter, give it up! Simpson's my man!"
Carl Carlson,"Hey, way to save our lives."
Lenny Leonard,"Yeah, we owe you one."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor's a lot like a woman. You just have to read the manual and press the right button."
C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson -- Monty Burns. Come with me.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, now. That will do. Homer, for your bravery and skill, we award you this ham, this plaque, this discount coupon book, and my own personal thumbs up!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"And to insure your immortality, your heroic visage will be added to our Wall of Fame... Oh, and uh, what's this? A congratulatory phone call from Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson."
Homer Simpson,Magic Johnson! Y'ello.
Magic Johnson,Is this really Homer Simpson?
Homer Simpson,Yeah.
Magic Johnson,"Wow. Homer, I just used our last time out to call and congratulate you on diverting that nuclear holocaust."
Homer Simpson,"Well, thank you."
Doctor,"Magic, if you play on that ankle, you'll be in incredible pain."
Magic Johnson,I don't care.
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Magic. What if people think a guy's a hero but he was really just lucky?"
Magic Johnson,Don't worry. Sooner or later people like that are exposed as the frauds they are.
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Magic."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, you're not laughing. Too subtle?"
Luann Van Houten,"I'll think about it, Marge."
Bart Simpson,Nah. I'm just depressed. Milhouse's mom won't let me play with him any more.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham? And what's all this?"
Marge Simpson,"""For heroic competence... for narrowly averting a melt-down and proving, without question, that nuclear power is completely safe... Employee-of-the-Month!"" Ohh, Homer!"
Lisa Simpson,A role model in my very own home. How convenient.
Homer Simpson,"Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work. I don't need it here at home."
Marge Simpson,"How are you enjoying your ham, Homie?"
Homer Simpson,It tastes so bitter. It's like ashes in my mouth!
Marge Simpson,"Hmm, it's actually more of a honey glaze --"
Lisa Simpson,Maybe you ate a clove.
Homer Simpson,"What's your problem, boy?"
Bart Simpson,I had a fight with Milhouse.
Homer Simpson,That four-eyes with the big nose? You don't need friends like that.
Lisa Simpson,How Zen.
Homer Simpson,What? What is it? What are you doing?
Lisa Simpson,Looking at you with quiet awe.
Homer Simpson,"Well, as long as it's quiet."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Milhouse to Bart, Milhouse to Bart... Please don't hate me. Please?"
,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, right next to the boss. Eh, he'll never know who did it."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah Simpson! There's someone I want you to meet. Aristotle Amadopolis, owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power facility."
Homer Simpson,Huh? Wha?...
C. Montgomery Burns,It seems Ari's been having terrible worker problems at Shelbyville.
Aristotle,They've lost their zest for work. You must help them find their Eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve!
Homer Simpson,Their Eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what?
Aristotle,Yeah.
C. Montgomery Burns,We want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of donut-eating goof-offs into a pack of Homer Simpsons.
Homer Simpson,"But I really can't tell them anything, sir."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh cut the false modesty, it's getting tiresome. Besides, it's your duty. Employee of the Month isn't all ham and plaques."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well! Smithers, how kind of you to pay us a visit."
Waylon Smithers,"Couldn't help it, sir. The parking here is terrible."
Aristotle,This man has no love for his power plant.
C. Montgomery Burns,Begone from my sight.
C. Montgomery Burns,That one's always been a problem.
,
Bart Simpson,One... two... three... Community chest.
Bart Simpson,Nah.
Bart Simpson,Nah.
Bart Simpson,Ah. I've won second prize in a beauty contest. Collect ten bucks.
Bart Simpson,Ha ha! You're losing.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, don't feed your sister hotels!"
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry mom, there's tons of these things."
Marge Simpson,I think that game is too old for her. Why don't you go play with Milhouse?
Bart Simpson,I don't wanna play with Milhouse.
Marge Simpson,You mean you still haven't made up with him?
Bart Simpson,"It's his mom. She says I'm a bad influence. C'mon Maggie, let's go throw rocks at that hornet's nest."
,
Marge Simpson,"Mrs. Van Houten, I'm Bart's mother -- we met in the emergency room when the boys drank paint."
Luann Van Houten,"I remember. Please, come in."
,
Luann Van Houten,"Marge, I'm sorry, but I think it would be better if Milhouse didn't see your son."
Marge Simpson,"Look, I know Bart can be a handful but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... of course it makes him do bad things..."
Luann Van Houten,"Well, Marge, the other day, Milhouse told me my meatloaf sucks. He must have gotten that from your little boy, because they certainly don't say that word on TV!"
Marge Simpson,"Well, I can't defend everything he does. But let's face it, all Bart and Milhouse have is each other. They're too young for girls. And they're a popular target for bullies. And in the Christmas pageant, they're always sheep. Please, please, let them be friends!"
Barney Gumble,"So the next time somebody tells you county folk are good, honest people, you can spit in their faces for me!"
Lisa Simpson,"I will, Mr. Gumbel. But if you'll excuse me, I'm profiling my dad for the school paper. I thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick."
Barney Gumble,"Oh, that's sweet. I used to follow my dad to a lot of bars too."
Moe Szyslak,"Here you go. One beer, one chocolate milk."
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, excuse me, I have the chocolate milk."
Moe Szyslak,Oh.
Moe Szyslak,"What's the matter, Homer? The depressin' effects of alcohol usually don't kick in 'til closing time."
Lisa Simpson,"He's just a little nervous. He has to give a speech tomorrow on ""How To Keep Cool In A Crisis."""
Homer Simpson,What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
Barney Gumble,"Hey, I had to give a speech once. I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick. I pictured everyone in their underwear. The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody."
Homer Simpson,Did it work?
Barney Gumble,"I'm a free man, ain't I?"
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Milhouse to Bart, do you want to come over and play?"
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Uh, I don't think so."
Bart Simpson,"Who cares?! Milhouse, I'll be right there! Sorry Maggie, game's over."
Bart Simpson,"Hey Mom, I'm friends with Milhouse again."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I knew his mother would come to her senses.."
,
Marge Simpson,What makes you think I did it?
Bart Simpson,Who else would?
Marge Simpson,You be good.
Bart Simpson,I will.
,
Aristotle,"As I look out into this sea of smiling faces, I am filled with a sense of loathing and revulsion. You are not workers, you are a pack of mangy cud-chewing ugly goats! Well, you're in for a treat. We have with us today a real man. Behold the glory that is Homer Simpson!"
Patient,Poor guy.
Homer Simpson,Uh... ladies and... gentlemen...
Thought Bubble Barney,Just picture them in their underwear.
Homer Simpson,"Um, Grace under pressure is no..."
Female Voice,Three minutes to meltdown.
Homer Simpson,Whew! Saved by the bell.
Female Voice,Fifteen seconds to core meltdown.
Aristotle,Just do what you did before.
Homer Simpson,All right.
,
Homer Simpson,"Eeenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe... If he hollers let him go, eenie meenie minee moe."
Female Voice,Crisis has been averted. Everything is super.
Aristotle,Thank you Homer for saving my plant with that idiotic rhyming. Do you even know what button you pushed?
Homer Simpson,Sure. Moe.
Kent Brockman,Eenie meenie minee moe / Is Homer a hero? / The answer is... no. I'm Kent Brockman and that was... My Two Cents. Now back to Scott Christian with Laugh and a Half.
SCOTT,"Thanks, Kent. There was more dumb luck in the news today when our own Police Chief Wiggum foiled a bank hold-up without even trying. It seems the chief had come to the bank to cash in his penny jar."
Chief Wiggum,"...48, 49, 50."
Security Guard,"Good work, Chief."
Chief Wiggum,Just doing my job.
SCOTT,"Yes, it seems the chief pulled a Homer Simpson of his own."
,
Barney Gumble,Whoa!
Barney Gumble,"Huh? A pretzel? Wow, looks like I pulled a Homer!"
,
Announcer,"The Lakers have the ball. Magic Johnson's coming down the floor on a fast break. Magic stops. His feet slip out from under him. The ball flies out of his hand, hits the referee in the head, goes in the basket! It's a three point play. The Lakers win!"
Magic Johnson,Looks like I pulled a Homer.
,
Lisa Simpson,Our dad... now he belongs to the ages.

,
Krusty the Clown,I hold in my hand the final axe.
Krusty the Clown,"Well, kids, that's all the time we have for today."
Krusty the Clown,"I'd like to thank Sideshow Mel, Corporal Punishment, Tina Ballerina, oh, and from ""Knots Landing"" Miss Donna Mills. Oh, she was a sport."
Krusty the Clown,WE'VE HAD LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF FUN/ BUT NOW THE TIME HAS COME... TO GO/ IF THIS OLD CLOWN WAS FOUND DEAD IN HIS BED TOMORROW/ I'D BE IN HEAVEN STILL DOING THIS SHOW.
Krusty the Clown,See you some other time!
,
Miss Lois Pennycandy,"Great show, Krusty! I really laughed when you..."
Krusty the Clown,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where's my nicotine gum?"

Krusty the Clown,Cancel it.
Miss Lois Pennycandy,Therapist?
Krusty the Clown,Cancel it.
Miss Lois Pennycandy,Personal trainer?
Krusty the Clown,Cancel it.
Miss Lois Pennycandy,The opening line on the Giants is five and a half.
Krusty the Clown,Put a dime on it.
Miss Lois Pennycandy,Thank you dinner with Bart Simpson?
Krusty the Clown,I don't know any Bart Simpson.
Miss Lois Pennycandy,"Krusty, he's the boy who saved you from jail."
Chief Wiggum,"Well, we... made a terrible, terrible mistake. Uh... won't happen again."
Krusty the Clown,"Well, there was one boy who trusted me all along. Bart?"
Bart Simpson,"Yes, sir?"
Krusty the Clown,Thank you.
,
Krusty the Clown,Oh yeah. Cancel it.
,
Marge Simpson,Hello?
,
Miss Lois Pennycandy,"Mrs. Simpson, this is Lois Pennycandy, Krusty the Clown's executive assistant."
Marge Simpson,"Oh hello, Mrs. Pennycandy."
Miss Lois Pennycandy,Read this.
Miss Lois Pennycandy,"It's Miss Pennycandy, I can assure you. I'm sorry to inform you that Krusty will once again not be joining Bart for dinner."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, dear. This is the fifth time he's cancelled. How can he hurt someone who loves him so?"
Miss Lois Pennycandy,"Oh, Mrs. Simpson, I've wasted my womanhood asking that same question. I apologize for him, something really important came up at the last minute."
,
Krusty the Clown,"Lousy mildew. Eh, that's good enough."
,
Marge Simpson,"Well, thank you for calling. Good-bye."
Bart Simpson,"Okay Milhouse, how many Krusty autographs should I put you down for?"
,
Milhouse Van Houten,A hundred.
Bart Simpson,Consider it done.
Bart Simpson,YOU'RE WALKING ALONG THE STREET/ OR YOU'RE AT A PARTY/ OR ELSE YOU'RE ALONE/ AND THEN YOU SUDDENLY DIG... DIG... DIG.
,
Bart Simpson,THIS COULD BE THE START OF SOMETHING BIG...
Marge Simpson,"Sweetie, I'm sorry, but Krusty isn't coming to dinner again."
Bart Simpson,"Aw, man."
Bart Simpson,"Dear Krusty, this is Bart Simpson, Krusty Buddy #16302 respectfully returning his Badge..."
,
Bart Simpson,"...I always suspected that nothing in life mattered. Now I know for sure. Get bent, Bart Simpson."
,
Krusty the Clown,Ooh. Sex chat!
Sexy Female Recording,"You have reached the party line! In a moment you'll be connected to a hot party with some of the world's most beautiful women. Now, let's join the party!"
Krusty the Clown,Hello?
Larry,Hello?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Are, are there any women here?"
Krusty the Clown,Hello?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Are you a beautiful woman?
Krusty the Clown,Do I sound like a beautiful woman?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,This is not the sort of party as I had anticipated.
Kids,
Krusty the Clown,"Uh...ehhh... deeee... eeee... deeaar... Dear... Krust...""y""...?"
Miss Lois Pennycandy,"It says that the little boy who never lost faith in you has lost faith in you. Krusty, you are going to Bart Simpson's house for dinner tonight."
Krusty the Clown,But I have plans.
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, not the face."
PENNYCANDY,"Why you, maddening, impossible man. If you don't go tonight, I won't be here tomorrow."
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, alright. I'll go."
Krusty the Clown,But I sure hate missing Schnapps Night at the Friars Club.
,
Marge Simpson,"Bart, wipe your feet."
Bart Simpson,"Why bother, they'll just get dirty again."
Marge Simpson,I've got some good news. Krusty the Clown is coming to dinner tonight.
Bart Simpson,"He is, for sure?"
Marge Simpson,Yes.
Bart Simpson,God bless that clown.
Homer Simpson,You think it's him?
Krusty the Clown,"Hi, kids! Hey, hey!"
Krusty the Clown,"Heh, heh, cute kid."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, hi Bart. I was just in the neighborhood. Why Krusty the Clown! What a surprise."
Bart Simpson,Milhouse. You can come in and drop the charade.
Bart Simpson,"Krusty, you don't have to be ""on"" tonight."
Homer Simpson,What are you talking about? Of course he does.
Lisa Simpson,"No, Dad, Krusty is our guest. Your pratfalls and Punchinello antics aren't necessary here."
Krusty the Clown,Really?
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, just relax and be yourself."
Krusty the Clown,"Ohh, that's a relief."
Krusty the Clown,Go wait in the car.
Homer Simpson,We could have seen a monkey.
Marge Simpson,Who wants to say grace?
Lisa Simpson,Why don't we let our guest do it?
Milhouse Van Houten,Bless us O lord...
Milhouse Van Houten,Hey!
Bart Simpson,"Krusty, would you do the honors?"
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,No! A clown is not a respected member of the community.
,
Krusty the Clown,"Well, alright. I'm a little rusty, but um, I'll try. Baruch ata, addonoy, elohanu melech ha-olom, ha-motzee le-chem mean ha-aretz."
Homer Simpson,He's talking funny talk.
Lisa Simpson,"No, Dad, that's Hebrew. Krusty must be Jewish."
Homer Simpson,A Jewish entertainer? Get outta here.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, There are many prominent Jewish entertainers including Lauren Bacall, Dinah Shore, William Shatner, and Mel Brooks."
Homer Simpson,Mel Brooks is Jewish?
Bart Simpson,"Krusty, are you alright?"
Krusty the Clown,"Yes, it's just that saying the brucha brings back a lot of painful memories. The old days... my... my father..."
Homer Simpson,"Hey Krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf or what?"
Lisa Simpson,"Poor Krusty, he's like a black velvet painting come to life."
Marge Simpson,"Krusty, why don't you tell us what's wrong? You'll feel better."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, spill your guts, man."
Lisa Simpson,Come on...
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, Krusty, tell us."
Krusty the Clown,"Well, okay. First of all, my real name isn't Krusty the Clown, it's Hershel Krustofsky. My father was a rabbi. His father was a rabbi. His father's father -- well, you get the idea."
,
Krusty the Clown,My father was the most respected man in the lower east side of Springfield. People would come from miles around to ask his advice.
Man #1,"Reb Krustofsky, should I finish college?"
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Yes. No one is poor except he who lacks knowledge.
Woman,"Rabbi, should I have another child?"
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Yes, another child would be a blessing on your house."
Man #2,"Rabbi, should I buy a Chrysler?"
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Could you rephrase that as a, as a ethical question?"
Man #2,Hmm... is it right to buy a Chrysler?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Yes, for great is the car with power steering and dyna-flow suspension."
,
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Hershel, life is not fun. Life is serious. Seltzer is for drinking, not for spraying. Pie is for noshing, not for throwing."
Krusty the Clown,"But papa, can't..."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,But nothing! You'll do as I say or you'll get such a zetz that you won't even know what hit you.
,
Krusty the Clown,"Dad wanted me to follow in his footsteps, but the pull of clowning was too strong. I got my first big laughs at Yeshiva impersonating my father."
,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps."
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, I don't even like using the bathroom after you."
Homer Simpson,Why you little...
Lisa Simpson,"Krusty, please continue."
Krusty the Clown,Okay.
,
Krusty the Clown,My father tried to extinguish the comedy bug. But it was no use.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,What are you doing in that bathroom?
Krusty the Clown,Go away.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Open the door this instant.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Oy gevalt!
Krusty the Clown,Close the door!
,
Krusty the Clown,Then came my big break. A Talmudic conference in the Catskills and I was the entertainment.
Krusty the Clown,But the Lord works in mysterious ways.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Do you know that my son Hershel was first in his Yeshiva class. As a matter of fact, he was voted ""The Most Likely to Hear God."""
Rabbi #1,"Oh go on, Hymie. You're exaggerating again. You're so proud of your son."
,
Krusty the Clown,"My father would have never have suspected a thing, were it not for one rowdy rabbi."
Rowdy Rabbi,"Hey, Funny-man!"
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Hershel? Hershel! Oy vay iz mir!
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,I have no son!
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"You have brought shame on our family. Oh, if you were a musician or a jazz singer, this I could forgive. But, but-but this? I never want to see you again. You... you... clown!"
,
Krusty the Clown,And I haven't seen my father since.
Lisa Simpson,That is so sad.
Bart Simpson,"Krusty, do you think about your father a lot?"
Krusty the Clown,All the time. Except when I'm at the track. Then it's all business.
Krusty the Clown,"Look at you, Bart."
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, isn't that fun?"
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, whoa."
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, the Fourth of July. I can't believe that little boy in the pictures is you, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, I've got a lot of fond memories."
Marge Simpson,"Well, look at the time. Almost midnight."
Krusty the Clown,Do you have any yearbooks?
Homer Simpson,"No, that's it. You've seen everything."
Krusty the Clown,"So uh, Milhouse, know any knock-knock jokes?"
Milhouse Van Houten,I want to go home.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home."
Homer Simpson,Gladly.
Krusty the Clown,Wow. The Concert For Bangladesh.
Bart Simpson,"Goodnight, Krusty. Sorry about your dad."
Krusty the Clown,"Don't worry about me, I'm a survivor."
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, did I leave my keys inside?"
Bart Simpson,No!
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, yeah. Here they are."
,
,
Announcer,"Academy Award Playhouse now returns you to ""Hercules vs. The Martians."""
Martian,"Welcome to our spaceship, mighty Hercules."
,
,
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Hello? Hello? Anybody there?
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh great, we came all this way and it's the wrong guy."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,I didn't mean that literally.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"What's this? I hear a phone ring and all of a sudden there's nothing. I'm listening and there's no talking. Hello. Mister, who are you? Why would they call ya if they don't want to talk to ya."
,
,
Krusty the Clown,"Didn't Itchy Jr. look happy playing with his father? And didn't Scratchy Jr. look happy playing with his dad until they got run over by a thresher? Wasn't that a beautiful cartoon? For the love of God, cut to a commercial."
Bart Simpson,Poor Krusty.
Lisa Simpson,A man who envies our family is a man who needs help.
Bart Simpson,We've got to do something.
Lisa Simpson,Let's move.
,
Bart Simpson,"Reverend Lovejoy, we need you to help us find a rabbi."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, um... before you make any rash decisions, let me just remind you that the church is changing to meet the needs of today's young Christians."
Lisa Simpson,"No, no. We're not converting, we just want to find a Rabbi Krustofsky."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Rabbi Krustofsky? Why, I do a radio call-in show with him every Sunday night."
Bart Simpson,Really?
Lisa Simpson,I didn't know that.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Gee, I mention it in my sermon every week."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, oh, that radio show."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh yeah, it's all the kids talk about on Monday at school."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, well. Why have a free T-shirt. You'll be the ""coolest"" kids on the playground."
Bart Simpson,We'll put them on later. Now can you give us the rabbi's address?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh sure thing. Let me just check my ""Non-Christian"" rolodex."
,
Lisa Simpson,I bet the rabbi misses Krusty.
Bart Simpson,"He'll be so happy, he'll be crying in his beard."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Excuse us, Rabbi Krustofsky?"
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Oh, what can I do for you, my young friends?"
Bart Simpson,We came to talk to you about your son.
D.J.,"And in order to keep our broadcasting license, we devote Sunday night dead time to public service shows of limited appeal."
D.J.,"In that spirit, we bring you ""Gabbin' about God,"" sponsored by Ace Religion Supply where they say: ""If we don't got it, it ain't holy."""
D.J.,"With us tonight, once again, our very own three wise men: Reverend Timothy Lovejoy, Monsignor Kenneth Daley, and Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky."
D.J.,"Okay, and our first caller is from Shelbyville Heights."
Caller,"Yes, hi, with all the suffering and injustice in the world, do you ever wonder if God really exists?"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,No.
MONSIGNOR DALEY,Not for a second.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Not at all.
D.J.,Great. Good conversation there. Our next call now is for the good Rabbi.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Hello? Anybody there? I hear breathing but I don't hear talking. What's going on here? Hello, mister. Hello... hello."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Some people got nothing to do but call people and hang up. There's all kinds of meshugoyim in the world.
,
,
D.J.,"Okay, let's clear the board. Our next caller is a young boy from right here in Springfield."
Bart Simpson,"Hello, my name's Dimitri. I'm a first time caller, long time listener."
,
Bart Simpson,"My question is, ""If a son defies his father, and chooses a career that makes millions of children happy, shouldn't the father forgive the son?"""
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,I think so.
MONSIGNOR DALEY,"Yes, of course."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,No way. Absolutely not. Never! Never! Who screens these calls? Who's in charge here? There's nobody in charge. They leave a building without people watching it and anybody who wants can call any stupid person they please...
,
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, Lis. I've got a plan that can't fail."
,
Bart Simpson,"Yiddle my man, you're a genius."
Yiddle,I love my work.
,
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Oh, the best charity is to give and not let other people know."
Rabbi #2,But what if your example encourages others to give?
Bart Simpson,"Speaking of charity, Rabbi Krustofsky, don't you think it's time you forgave your son?"
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Don't you understand that my boy broke my heart? He turned his back on our traditions and our faith, and on me. Get out of here you little pisher!"
,
Bart Simpson,"Oy, this guy's tough."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, we're gonna have to out smart him."
Bart Simpson,"I don't know, he's pretty sharp. He saw right through this disguise."
,
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"What? Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize winning Jewish novelist. He wants to have lunch with me? Ah ah, It's a date! Izzy's Deli, one o'clock, I'll be there."
,
Krusty the Clown,"The French government wants to give me The Legion of Honor? Where do I receive this prestigious award? Izzy's Deli, one o'clock. Thank you, Monsieur President."
,
Bart Simpson,Au revoir.
,
Waitress,Are you kids ready to order yet?
Bart Simpson,"Sorry, no. Just get us another bowl of complimentary pickles."
Waitress,Watch how fast I go.
Waitress,And for you sir?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Oh, let's see. I want a nice sandwich, but the Joey Bishop, ugh, too fatty... the Jackie Mason, I don't know, sauerkraut makes me gassy. The Bruce Willis, I don't even like his work... What is this?... Krusty the Clown!?"
Waitress,"That's ham, sausage and bacon with a smidge of mayo..."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,What?
Waitress,... on white bread.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Listen, you tell Mr. Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize winning Jewish novelist, that I lost my appetite."
Krusty the Clown,"Uh, could you direct me to President Francois Mitterrand's table?"
Waitress,You think you're funny?
Krusty the Clown,Fifty million Frenchmen can't be wrong.
Bart Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, we've been going about this all wrong. What's the one thing rabbis prize above everything else?"
Bart Simpson,Those stupid hats?
Lisa Simpson,No Bart. Knowledge.
,
Lisa Simpson,We're gonna hit him where it hurts. Right in the Judaica.
Bart Simpson,"Ahhh, Noah, Noah, save us, save us... No!!"
Lisa Simpson,This looks good Bart. Take it to him.
,
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,You I told to go away.
Bart Simpson,"But... but... but, but Rabbi, does it not say in the Babylonian Talmud... And I quote, ""A child should be pushed aside with the left hand, and drawn closer with the right."""
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Yes.
Bart Simpson,Then doesn't your religion command you to make up with Krusty?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"But in Exodus, the fifth commandment says, ""Honor thy Father and thy Mother."" End of story."
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, it's hopeless."
Lisa Simpson,Not quite. I got some dynamite stuff from Rabbi Simon ben Eleazar.
,
Bart Simpson,At all times let a man be supple as a reed and not rigid as a cedar.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"But, my short learned friend, the Book of Joshua says, ""You shall meditate on the Torah all day and all night."""
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Is it not written in the Talmud, ""Who will bring redemption? The jesters."""
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Sorry my friend, I'm still not convinced. And this is hardly the time or place to discuss it."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Here you go, Bart. It's a long shot, but, that's all I can do without learning ancient Hebrew."
Lisa Simpson,Bart! I am not gonna learn ancient Hebrew.
,
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,No one could be / so gentle and so LOVEABLE / Oh mein papa / he always understood.
Moe Szyslak,I got somethin' in my eye.
Barney Gumble,"Here, take my hanky."
Moe Szyslak,Eeww!
Bart Simpson,"Rabbi, did not a great man say, and I quote, ""The Jews are a swinging bunch of people. I mean, I've heard of persecution, but what they went through is ridiculous! But the great thing is after thousands of years of waiting and holding on and fighting, they finally made it."" End quote."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Ohh, I never heard the plight of my people phrased so eloquently. Who said that, Rabbi Hillel?"
Bart Simpson,Nope.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,It was Judah the Pious?
Bart Simpson,Nope.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Mamonides?
Bart Simpson,Nope.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Oh, I got it -- the Dead Sea Scrolls."
Bart Simpson,"I'm afraid not, Rabbi. It's from ""Yes, I Can"" by Sammy Davis Jr. An entertainer like your son."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,The candy man?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"If a performer can think that way, maybe I'm completely upside-down on this whole problem. All the years of joy that I've lost. Why? Because of my stubborn ways."
Lisa Simpson,"There, there, Rabbi. It's not too late."
,
Krusty the Clown,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, kids... Today's show is gonna be the funniest, sidesplitin'est, cavalcade of... ah the hell with it. Roll the cartoon."
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, yeah. My old friends, right next to my heart."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Oy, such a filthy habit."
Krusty the Clown,Who asked you? Father?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Son!
Krusty the Clown,Papa!
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Hershel.
Krusty the Clown,Daddy.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Boychik!
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, Daddy..."
Stagehand,"You're on, Krusty."
Krusty the Clown,"Boys and girls, I'd like to be serious for a moment if I may. Spotlight, please."
Krusty the Clown,I just wanted... I just wanted... Come on guys. I'm not doing the spotlight bit.
Krusty the Clown,"Let's have a warm Krusty welcome for my estranged father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky."
Krusty the Clown,"Lenny, a little reconciliation music if you please... Oh mein papa / to me he was so wonderful / Oh mein papa/ Come on, Dad / to me he was so good/ You know the words."
Krusty the Clown,We haven't seen each other in twenty-five years.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Oh, I love you, son."
Krusty the Clown,"I love you too, Daddy."

Marge Simpson,We're home!
Homer Simpson,Get a good haul this year?
Bart Simpson,Heh heh heh...Jackpot!
Homer Simpson,"I am very, very proud of you kids."
Bart Simpson,We would have gotten even more if Lisa could walk faster.
Lisa Simpson,I didn't select this costume for mobility. I wore it to salute the noble native American of the Pacific Northwests...
Lisa Simpson,YAHHH!
Marge Simpson,"Now children, you can have one piece of candy tonight and save the rest for..."
Marge Simpson,If you eat too much you'll have nightmares.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah. Everybody in the family is gonna have a bad nightmare tonight."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh yeah, three bad nightmares."
Homer Simpson,I'd like to see that.

Homer Simpson,What a dump. Why would Princess Grace live in a place like this?
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, that's Monaco."
Homer Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,I can do that but I don't wanna.
Homer Simpson,Eeuhgh. What is this thing?
Merchant,"It is a monkey's paw, dating back to Allal ben Abdallah. It has the power to grant wishes to its owner."
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? How much?
Marge Simpson,Look everybody! My purse exploded!
Merchant,"Sir, I must strongly advise you do not purchase this. Behind every wish lurks grave misfortune. I myself was once President of Algeria..."
Homer Simpson,"C'mom pal, I don't wanna hear your life story. Paw me!"

Marge Simpson,"Ugghh, Homer. Where did you get that ugly thing?"
Homer Simpson,"Why at that little shop, right over... there."
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, wait, it was over there."

Woman #2,"At first they were cute and funny, but now they're just annoying."

Otto Mann,"Man, this thing's really gettin' outta hand."
,
Helen Lovejoy,"Oh, is there anything they won't do?"

Marge Simpson,"Oh Homer, this is awful."

Townspeople,Happy thoughts... happy thoughts... what a good day... happy thoughts...

Dr. Marvin Monroe,"You like attention, don't you Bart?"
Bart Simpson,Do I ever!
DR MONROE,"Well we all do. The problem is that you don't care whether you get good attention, for say getting good marks in school, or bad attention for .. say.. turning your father into a Jack-in-the-box."
Dr. Marvin Monroe,"Homer, I see you agree with my theory."
Homer Simpson,I'm not nodding. It's the air conditioning.
Dr. Marvin Monroe,Well that's too bad because the attention the boy craves should be coming from you. I want you to spend some quality time with him. Get to know him. Maybe even love him.
Homer Simpson,Ouch!

C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, to the laboratory."
,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know Smithers, I've always despised the laziness of the common worker. Then I realized his spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak.

C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, who is a model ... employee?"
Waylon Smithers,"Ehhh... Simpson will do just fine, sir."
Waylon Smithers,"Did you hear that, sir?"

C. Montgomery Burns,Oh... bad corpse. Bad corpse. Stop scaring Smithers. Satisfied?
Waylon Smithers,"Thank you, sir."

Lisa Simpson,"Whayda ya know, she's right."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"It wasn't suppose to be this way. It was supposed to be a thing of beauty, not this abomination."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh Smithers, I was wrong to play god. Life is precious, not a thing to be toyed with. Now, take out that brain and flush it down the toilet."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, his family might appreciate it if you returned the brain to his body."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, come on. It's 11:45."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, Smithers, when you look at me with those puppy dog eyes... all right."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, do you know what this means? He is alive."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh you're right, Smithers. I guess I owe you a coke."
C. Montgomery Burns,"And as for you, you clinking, clattering, cacophony of colligenous cogs and camshafts, take that."
C. Montgomery Burns,Ahhh!
Waylon Smithers,"Run, sir!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Every bone... shattered... organs... leaking vital fluids. Slight headache... loss of appetite. Smithers, I'm going to die."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, is there nothing I can do?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, perhaps. Smithers go to my office. In the third drawer of my desk are surgical tools and some ether..."
,
Marge Simpson,"Did you have a nightmare, Homie?"
Homer Simpson,No. Bart bit me.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, man, you were crushing me. I tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab."
Homer Simpson,I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,Perhaps you're wondering why you have two heads? Well my body was crushed so I had my head grafted on to or shall we say ample frame.
Homer Simpson,I didn't wake up. It's all a dream. It's just a dream!
C. Montgomery Burns,Oh that's right. It's all a dream.
C. Montgomery Burns,Or is it?
TV Announcer,Next week on The Simpsons.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Don't forget dad, tonight my class is having an all you can eat spaghetti dinner."
Homer Simpson,Umm. Spaghetti.
C. Montgomery Burns,"But Homer, tonight's our reception for Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I hate having two heads."
Homer-Ape,Oooh.
Homer-Ape,Ahhh.
,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I'm calling about the school talent show."
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I know it's tonight."
Little Man,Alto or tenor?
Lisa Simpson,"No. Dad, I broke my last saxophone reed, and I need you to get me a new one."
Homer Simpson,Uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother's better at?
Lisa Simpson,"I called her. She's not home. I also tried Mr. Flanders, Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement."
Homer Simpson,"Wow! And after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. Uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Well, you're in for a whale of a show tonight. I'd like to point out that the doors are now locked, so you parents can't sneak out of the show after your own child has performed. Oh, and let me caution the people in the first five rows, you will get wet."
,
Homer Simpson,"Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer?"
,
Homer Simpson,"Hurry, Moe, hurry! I've only got five minutes till the music store closes."
Moe Szyslak,Why don't you go there first?
Homer Simpson,"Hey, do I tell you how to do your job?"
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"You know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top."
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Homer."
,
Lunchlady Doris,This is a whole lotta nothin'.
Groundskeeper Willie,I'd rather be watching the boilers!
Seymour Skinner,"Oh well, make sure you return those chairs to the cafeteria, Kim. I'm not kidding."
,
Homer Simpson,Ah. Finished with fifteen seconds to spare.
Little Man,"What's the matter, buddy?"
Homer Simpson,The moron next door closed early!
Little Man,I happen to be that moron.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, me and my trenchant mouth."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Terrible, just terrible. You know, they seem to get worse every year."
Homer Simpson,"Hmm. ""Lisa stop playing that stupid... saxophone!"" Yes! That's it!"
Seymour Skinner,"Wonderful. You know, I think this is the best batch we've ever had. I really do. And now, here's Bart Simpson, The Boy of a Thousand Voices."
Bart Simpson,I'd like to open with my impression of Principal Skinner.
Bart Simpson,"Duh, look at me, I'm Principal Skinner."
Seymour Skinner,That young man just became the Boy of a Thousand Days Detention.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, it's Lunchlady Doris. I wonder what she's got for us today. Today's special is refried dog poop."
Bleeding Gums Murphy,
,
Homer Simpson,"Please, you've got to open that store."
Little Man,Let me think about it... Eh... No.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing. Well I don't have one."
Moe Szyslak,"Come on, Jer. Open up. Be a pal. Remember when I pulled you and your wife out of that burning car?"
Little Man,Okay. Okay. But now we're even. So what does your daughter need?
Homer Simpson,"I'll have you know, I wrote it down."
Homer Simpson,Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum!
Homer Simpson,Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo!
Little Man,Uh-huh. And what instrument does she play?
Homer Simpson,I dunno.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, where is he? If I don't get that reed I'll sound terrible."
Marge Simpson,"Don't worry, honey, I'm sure your father is..."
Marge Simpson,Maybe.
Marge Simpson,No.
Marge Simpson,That's a long shot.
Marge Simpson,Bingo.
Marge Simpson,"Don't worry, he'll be here."
,
Little Man,Clarinet?
Homer Simpson,No.
Little Man,Oboe?
Homer Simpson,No.
Little Man,Saxophone?
Homer Simpson,No!... Wait a minute. What was that last one again?
Little Man,Saxophone?
,
Chuck,My ding-a-ling / My ding-a-ling / I want you to play with my ding-a-ling --
Seymour Skinner,"This act is over! Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to put this filth behind us, and let's all enjoy Lisa Simpson's rendition of ""Stormy Leather -- ah, Weather."""
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw.
Groundskeeper Willie,Sounds like that gopher I caught in me lawnmower.
,
Homer Simpson,"Whew, I'd hate to be that kid's father."
,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.
Seymour Skinner,That'll do.
Lisa Simpson,It's not my fault. It's the reed.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh yes, of course. It's the reed."
Seymour Skinner,Let's hear it for Lisa Simpson and her wacky sax.
Homer Simpson,Yeah! Woo! Woo! Yeah!
,
,
Teenager,"Okay, who ordered the Mount Bellyache?"
Homer Simpson,I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh.
Lisa Simpson,I'm done.
Homer Simpson,That cost eighty-eight dollars!
Lisa Simpson,"I'm sorry dad, I don't feel much like eating."
Homer Simpson,"Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know that doesn't make it right, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me."
Lisa Simpson,I forgive you.
Homer Simpson,You didn't mean that!
Lisa Simpson,No. I didn't.
,
Marge Simpson,"Look Homer, Lisa's taking her first steps."
Marge Simpson,Yes.
Baby Lisa,Da-da. Da-da.
Marge Simpson,"Did you hear that, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,No wonder she hates me. I never even noticed that she was alive.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, if you want to make up with Lisa just spend some time with her."
Homer Simpson,Okay.
Homer Simpson,"Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie."
Marge Simpson,"Homie, you've got to stop looking for the quick fix. If you keep spending time with Lisa, she'll forgive you."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. Let's see, quick fix, quick fix. Ah, I'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for."
Marge Simpson,We can't afford to buy a pony.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony."
Marge Simpson,That's ridiculous.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I've got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa's eyes, I don't see love anymore."
Marge Simpson,That's no reason to buy a pony!
Homer Simpson,"See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes."
Marge Simpson,Stick to the subject.
Homer Simpson,"Ha ha, you love me."
Marge Simpson,Let's be realistic. A pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Marge Simpson,You sound like you're going to buy a pony. Promise me you won't.
Homer Simpson,Mm.
Marge Simpson,What was that? Was that a yes or a no?
Homer Simpson,Buh.
Marge Simpson,Those aren't even words!
Homer Simpson,Sneh.
,
,
Salesclerk,"Oh my, what is that smell?"
Salesclerk,"Oh, it's you."
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, do you sell ponies?"
Salesclerk,"Uh, sure pal, right here."
Homer Simpson,"""Scot-tish deer-hound."" Hey, this is a dog!"
Salesclerk,"My friend, you're smarter than I gave you credit for. I suggest you try the pony farm on Route 401. Merely take a left at the rendering plant."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Now lady, I'm buying this pony for my little girl, and I don't care what it costs."
Millicent,Very good. That stunning creature over there is half a million dollars.
Homer Simpson,Half a million dollars?!
Millicent,He was sired by Seattle Slew and his mother won the Kentucky Derby.
Homer Simpson,Wow!
Millicent,His likeness graces a stamp in Tanzania...
Homer Simpson,I'll take it!
Millicent,"Mr. Simpson, do you have half a million dollars?"
Homer Simpson,"Uh, sure... let me write you a check."
Millicent,"Mr. Simpson, this check is dated January 1, 2054."
Homer Simpson,Is there a problem with that?
Millicent,Our ponies start at five thousand dollars. Cash.
Homer Simpson,Isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home?
Millicent,I sincerely hope not.
,
,
Homer Simpson,I-I'd like to borrow five thousand dollars.
Female Clerk,"Sorry, I can't approve a loan that size myself."
C. Montgomery Burns,Hel-lo.
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? How can I help you?"
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, you do this personally?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"It's a hobby. I'm not in this for any personal gain, heavens no. By the way, are you acquainted with our state's stringent usury laws?"
Homer Simpson,U-su-ry?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Silly me, I must have just made up a word that doesn't exist. Now, what is the purpose of this loan?"
Homer Simpson,I want to buy a pony.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Isn't that cute? Smithers, he's planning on joining the horsey set. That is it, isn't it? You're not planning to eat it?"
Homer Simpson,No. I need to get it for my little girl because she doesn't love me any more.
Waylon Smithers,"Shut up, Simpson."
Homer Simpson,Sorry.
Waylon Smithers,Do you have any collateral?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh Smithers, let's not be so cold. His spirit is my collateral. Just sign this form and the money will be yours."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Sorry, I was just, uh, thinking of something funny Smithers did today."
Waylon Smithers,"I didn't do anything funny, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Shut up.
,
Millicent,"Mr. Simpson, are you quite sure you know how to take care of a pony?"
Homer Simpson,Of course.
,
Homer Simpson,"Simpson, you've done it again."
,
Lisa Simpson,"I love you, Dad!"
Marge Simpson,I am very upset with you.
Homer Simpson,Sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, how come Lisa gets a pony?"
Homer Simpson,Because she stopped loving me.
Bart Simpson,I don't love you either. So give me a moped.
Homer Simpson,I know you love me. So you don't get squat. Hee hee hee hee.
Lisa Simpson,Snowball II... Santa's Little Helper... this is Princess. Please don't exclude her because she's different.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse?"
Homer Simpson,I've got it all figured out. By day it will roam free around the neighborhood. And at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, no!"
Marge Simpson,That's illegal.
Homer Simpson,"That's for the courts to decide. Marge, she loves me."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I think Princess belongs in a stable."
Homer Simpson,Stable? That sounds expensive.
Homer Simpson,This is what love costs a month?
Millicent,"These are standard stable fees, Mr. Simpson. Plus, I'm teaching your daughter riding, grooming, and at no extra charge, pronunciation."
Lisa Simpson,"Father, you've made me the happiest girl who ever lived."
Homer Simpson,Oh nuts.
Grampa Simpson,What do I do? What do I do?
Bart Simpson,"Grampa, if you wanna go right..."
Grampa Simpson,Yes...
Bart Simpson,... move your joystick to the left.
Grampa Simpson,"Yes, move the... what's a joystick? You didn't tell me..."
Bart Simpson,"Uh-oh, here comes a Xylon cruiser. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go into hyperspace! Ready, hit it!"
Grampa Simpson,Wait. Where's the Hyperspace?
Bart Simpson,"Grampa, you're the spaceship, not the..."
Grampa Simpson,I'm the what? I thought I was this guy. Ohhh.
Bart Simpson,"Game's over, Grampa."
Grampa Simpson,I got down on the floor for this?
Lisa Simpson,"Wait, Dad, I've got something for you."
Homer Simpson,I was hoping it'd be money.
Marge Simpson,"Hmm, oh dear, we're in serious trouble here. We're just going to have to cut down on luxuries."
Homer Simpson,"Well you know, we're always buying Maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have."
Marge Simpson,"Actually, I was thinking we could cut down on your beer."
Homer Simpson,"Nah, we're not gonna be doing that."
Marge Simpson,Then I'm afraid there's no choice but to give up the pony back.
Homer Simpson,"First you didn't want me to get the pony. Now, you want me to take it back. Make up your mind."
Marge Simpson,Homer...
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Lisa loves me, the pony stays."
Marge Simpson,"All right. You got us into this, you get us out."
Homer Simpson,"Fine, I will. There's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work for it."
Homer Simpson,Do you have any jewelry you don't need anymore?
,
Lisa Simpson,You're so beautiful.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh look. You haven't touched your salt lick. Num num, good salt lick."
,
Homer Simpson,Need money. Need money.
Homer Simpson,"One Scratch-for-Cash, please."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Here you go.
Homer Simpson,"Liberty Bell... Two Liberty Bells... come on, come on, come on... Oh. Yes! Whoo-hoo! Three Liberty Bells! That'll be TEN thousand dollars, Apu."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh congratulations, Mr. Homer!"
Homer Simpson,Thank you.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,If I could just see the ticket...
Homer Simpson,There it is.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Please to be removing your thumb.
Homer Simpson,No.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes. Please, I must insist..."
Homer Simpson,No! No!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I've got to look at the ticket
Homer Simpson,No! You can't see... come on!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes, I must..."
Homer Simpson,No!
Homer Simpson,Let go. You're ripping it.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"A cherry! Oh, Mr. Homer, what has reduced you to such cheap chicanery?"
Homer Simpson,Ohh... I need money.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Well, if you need money you should have at least jammed a gun in my head or better yet you could inquire about my ""Help Wanted"" sign."
Homer Simpson,You're looking for help?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes. We need someone for the demanding, yet high-profile midnight to eight a.m. shift."
Homer Simpson,I'm your man!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,You're hired.
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Always I dreamed the day would come when one of you would be working for me!
,
Kevin,She certainly tamed that horse.
Ralph Wiggum,"Yes, but what man can tame her?"
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I won't lie to you. On this job you will be shot at.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Each of these bullet wounds is a badge of honor.
Homer Simpson,...Badge of honor.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Here's a pointer: try to take it in the shoulder.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Now, these hot dogs have been here for three years. They are strictly ornamental. There's only one bozo who comes in and buys them."
Homer Simpson,But I eat... Oh.
,
Homer Simpson,"Heh heh, the perfect crime."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, where have you been? I was so worried."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, could we go in the other room? I did something last night I'm not proud of and I don't want the kids to hear it."
Bart Simpson,Busted!
,
Homer Simpson,"I'll work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to spend as I please. Then I'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy."
Bart Simpson,"Oh my God, she killed him."
Homer Simpson,Mmm... salty.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Homer, are you stealing Squishees?"
Homer Simpson,No sir.
Lisa Simpson,"This next song is also about a girl and her pony. It's called ""Wildfire."""
Princess Kashmir,"Come on, Apu honey, loosen up."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"I'm sorry, baby. While I am here pleasuring you, my store is going down the tubes."
Princess Kashmir,
Ned Flanders,Three dollars and fifty-one... fifty-two... fifty-three cents.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Homer! You are asleep at your post! Now go change the expiration dates on the dairy products.
Homer Simpson,Yes sir.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Sorry baby, date's over."
,
,
Marge Simpson,"Homie, how long do you plan to do this?"
Homer Simpson,I don't know. How long do horses live?
Marge Simpson,Thirty years?
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,Mustn't sleep. Must monitor core.
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.
Lisa Simpson,"I just called to say I love you, Dad."
Homer Simpson,Thanks. When is she gonna stop loving me?
Johnny Carson,I just heard Millie Vanillie was just arrested for impersonating a McNugget.
Johnny Carson,"Well, it's true."
Bart Simpson,"Well, it's still fun to be up late."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Homer, where ya goin'?"
Homer Simpson,Going for... eight hour walk.
,
Homer Simpson,Homer sleep now.
Lisa Simpson,What's wrong with Dad?
Marge Simpson,"He's just exhausted. Lisa, do you know how much it costs to keep a pony?"
Lisa Simpson,No.
Marge Simpson,"Well, it's a lot. In fact, your father had to take a second job."
Bart Simpson,The poor guy. Where's he working?
Marge Simpson,The Kwik-E-Mart.
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, I hope you realize that your father can't keep this up."
Lisa Simpson,You're gonna make me give up Princess?
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, we can't make you give up that pony."
Bart Simpson,I can make her. Just give me five minutes alone with her.
Marge Simpson,"No, Bart. No one's going to make her. This is something Lisa has to decide for herself."
Lisa Simpson,All the years I've lobbied to be treated like an adult has blown up in my face.
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, pink hat, when I ordered that blueberry squishee, I meant today."
Homer Simpson,"Coming right up, sir."
Bart Simpson,And fill it to the top this time.
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir."
,
Lisa Simpson,"She likes a little carrot after her oats. And she really likes it when you scratch her behind the ear. And if you're playing the radio, she likes contemporary adult in the morning and easy listening at night. Please take good care of my Princess."
Millicent,"Although there is no change in my patrician facade, I can assure you my heart is breaking."
Lisa Simpson,I'll never forget you.
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"What--- wha, da, you call this melted cheese receptacle clean? Eh, the young man you replaced is rolling over in his grave."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you don't have to do this."
Homer Simpson,"Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing called money..."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I understand the sacrifice you've made for me. That's why I gave up the pony."
Homer Simpson,You did?
,
Lisa Simpson,Hmmm hmmm. There's a big dumb animal I love even more than that horse.
Homer Simpson,"Oh no! What is it, a hippopotamus!"
Lisa Simpson,"I mean you, you dummy."
Homer Simpson,Awww.
Homer Simpson,Apu. You can take this job and re-staff it!
Lisa Simpson,"Giddyup, Dad."
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"He slept, he stole, he was rude to the customers... still, there goes the best damn employee a convenience store ever had."
,
Announcer,Products you could only imagine before. The Foam Doam...the Jet Walker...Mr. Sugar Cube...
Homer Simpson,That baby changed our lives.
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Thank you, Troy. Hi, everybody."
Audience,"Hi, Dr. Nick."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Troy, I've brought with me the gravestone of author and troubled soul Edgar Allan Poe."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Yes, but unfortunately, a century of neglect has turned this tombstone into a depressing eyesore."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Not so fast Troy! With one application of Spiffy, you'll think the body's still warm."
Homer Simpson,Oooooh! That's one clean tombstone.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad, you got a power drill?"
Homer Simpson,In the garage.
Bart Simpson,Check.
Dr. Nick Riviera,I'm offering three bottles -- enough to clean one thousand tombstones -- for only thirty-nine ninety-five.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, give us a break, Doctor."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"But Troy, how can I make it lower than thirty-nine ninety-five."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Homer, I can't find the safety goggles for the power saw."
Homer Simpson,"If stuff starts flying, just turn your head."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, check."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Okay. I'll throw in a fourth bottle, the applicator glove, and a state of Kansas Jell-O mold -- twenty-nine ninety-five."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, calm down."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, can you get the door? It's my sisters."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, be nice."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I will. I will."
Homer Simpson,"Patty, Selma, what a pleasant surprise."
Patty Bouvier,"What do you know, he's wearing pants."
Selma Bouvier,I owe you a lunch.
Patty Bouvier,Ugly... ugly... butch...
Marge Simpson,"What's the matter, can't you find a hair style you like?"
Patty Bouvier,No... Hold the phone. That's the one for me.
Marge Simpson,Ed Asner?
Patty Bouvier,"No, next to him. Mary... Tyler... Moore."
Homer Simpson,"... Expiration date: June, 1999... Uh, 2012, yeah."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, are you ordering junk off the TV again?"
Homer Simpson,Shh! They'll hear you.
Marge Simpson,Who's using the power tools?
Homer Simpson,I don't know. Some guy I guess.
Marge Simpson,"Well, we're going to the beauty parlor. Maybe you should do something with the kids while I'm gone."
,
Lisa Simpson,Yes.
Homer Simpson,How much?
Lisa Simpson,Everything.
Homer Simpson,"What's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you?"
Lisa Simpson,Uh... take us to the video store.
Homer Simpson,Anything for my little girl.
Homer Simpson,Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid.
,
Homer Simpson,"Ooooooh, McBain."
Scoey,"Hey McBain, you keep eating them hot links and you'll never make it to a pension."
Scoey,"No, thanks. Got me a future, partner. I'm two days away from retirement, my daughter's graduating from college --"
Scoey,And as soon as we nail Mendoza my old lady and I are gonna sail around the world like we always wanted. We just christened the boat.
Scoey,"Yes, sir, everything's gonna be just perf..."
Scoey,"Aw, damn, damn, damn. McBain..."
Scoey,I'm not gonna make it.
Scoey,"No, no, no. Just do one thing for me... Get... Mendoza."
Teenage Clerk,"You want to rent it, sir?"
Homer Simpson,Why? I just saw the best part.
,
Lisa Simpson,"But, Dad, I can't find ""Happy Little Elves in Tinkly Winkly Town""."
Homer Simpson,Just grab something. All these movies are great.
,
Patty Bouvier,"Look at this. ""Test your F.Q. -- Fatherhood Quotient"". Maybe you should try it on Homer. He'll fail it."
Selma Bouvier,Uh-huh. In a second.
Marge Simpson,I don't know.
Selma Bouvier,"Now Henry Winkler, there's a father. Listen to what he told a close friend. ""I don't always keep my cool like `The Fonz', but my love for my kids has given me plenty of 'Happy Days'."""
,
Football Announcer,"... They called him ""The Galloping Gazelle."" His habitat: the frozen tundra of Soldier Field. For six seasons and two pro bowls he grazed on the tasty green turf of the end zone. Until one fateful Sunday in November when the gazelle was stopped in his tracks by a big cat named Wayne Kychezski."
Marge Simpson,"Homie, we're back."
Selma Bouvier,"Don't mind that clod, Patty. You could turn the world on with your smile."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, could you turn off the TV? There's a little test I want you to take."
Homer Simpson,"Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman."
Marge Simpson,This is from the National Fatherhood Institute. It evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father.
Homer Simpson,Oh Marge.
Marge Simpson,"Question one: ""Name one of your child's friends..."""
Homer Simpson,"Uh, let's see, Bart's friends... Well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets."
Marge Simpson,"They want a name, Homer, not a vague description."
Homer Simpson,Okay. Hank.
Marge Simpson,Hank?! Hank who?
Homer Simpson,Hank... Jones.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you made that up. Question two: ""Who is your son's hero?"""
Homer Simpson,Steve McQueen.
Marge Simpson,"That's your hero. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
Homer Simpson,Next.
Marge Simpson,What are your son's hobbies?
Homer Simpson,"Well, he's always chewing on that phone cord."
Marge Simpson,He hasn't done that since he was two.
Homer Simpson,Then he has no hobbies.
Marge Simpson,"Oh really? Well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see."
Homer Simpson,Bart!... BART!!!
Bart Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,"You don't have any hobbies, do you boy?"
Bart Simpson,"No, not really."
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing?"
Bart Simpson,Building a Soap Box Derby racer.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's a hobby!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, so it is."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my God. I don't know jack about my boy... I'm a bad father!"
Selma Bouvier,You're also fat.
Homer Simpson,I'm also fat!
Dave,National Fatherhood Institute. Please hold...
Gulliver Dark,AND THE CAT'S IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON / LITTLE BOY BLUE AND THE MAN IN THE MOON / WHEN YOU COMIN' HOME DAD / I DON'T KNOW WHEN...
Dave,National Fatherhood Institute. Dave speaking.
Homer Simpson,I'm Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero.
Barney Gumble,"Wow, it really is you."
Dave,"Good Lord, a zero! Lona, cancel my one o'clock. Mr. Simpson, we'll send a wood paneled station wagon over for you immediately."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey Bart, where'd you get the lumber?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, as three-time soapbox derby champ Ronnie Beck says, ""Poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine."""
Martin Prince,A conventional design.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah? Are you building a racer, Martin?"
Martin Prince,"In between some other projects. Well, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I've booked some time at the wind tunnel."
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, son."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey Bart, I think they're finally hauling your dad away."
Bart Simpson,Maybe it's for the best.
,
Dave,"For starters, Mr. Simpson, won't you take this complimentary copy of ""Fatherhood"" by Bill Cosby."
Homer Simpson,"Ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold."
Dave,"Mr. Simpson, if you want to be a good father, you have to spend time with your son."
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son?"
Dave,Why don't you ask him yourself?
Dave,"Homer, meet Dave Jr."
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Dave,"How's your research coming, son?"
DAVE JR.,I think we're near a breakthrough.
Dave,Good work.
DAVE JR.,"Thanks, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, how I envy you!"
Dave,"Homer, that easy back and forth that you just witnessed didn't happen over night. It took years of effort."
Homer Simpson,I've never been afraid of a little hard work.
Dave,"Aw, that's the spirit, Mr. Simpson. Now step one is to find an activity the two of you can share. Does the boy have any interests?"
Homer Simpson,What boy?
Dave,Your son. Find something he likes to do and share in it.
Homer Simpson,"Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer."
Dave,"Aw, that would be perfect."
Dave,Dear God! Not again.
,
Homer Simpson,Bart!... I'm gonna help you build that racer.
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, but I'm almost done. Why don't you get back on the couch and watch TV?"
Homer Simpson,"Okay. No, I'm gonna do it."
Bart Simpson,"Sorry dad, but three time Soap Box Derby champion Ronnie Beck never needed his dad's help."
Homer Simpson,But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree.
Homer Simpson,"What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you."
Bart Simpson,"Come on Dad, it'd be weird."
Homer Simpson,Oh this isn't working at all. It's hopeless... Wait a second.
Homer Simpson,"Hmm... ""Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite."" Huh?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that sounds too complicated."
Homer Simpson,"All right, I will! Son, I don't think you should let me help you."
Bart Simpson,"Ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes."
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons!"
Homer Simpson,"You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit."
Marge Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"I like our chances, son."
Official,"Ugh. Your father is not supposed to help build your racer, but you should at least consult him about it."
Homer Simpson,
Official,"You're in heat four. Whoa, where's your helmet, son?"
Bart Simpson,"Helmets are for wusses, Sir."
Official,I don't think I can let you go without a safety helmet.
,
Homer Simpson,This is my son and if he doesn't want to wear one you can't make him!
Official,"Okay, fine. I want to get out of here sometime today."
Martin Prince,"Attention, everyone. I say to those who question the value of the space program... Behold!"
Bart Simpson,Aye carumba!
Official,"Hey, you're not supposed to smoke in the pit area."
Nelson Muntz,Fine.
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, Simpson, where's your loser-mobile?"
Homer Simpson,"Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!"
Bart Simpson,"It's over there, Nelson."
Nelson Muntz,"Whoa, talk about your pieces of crap."
Martin Prince,"You know, Bart, I don't care who wins, as long as one of us beats that guy."
Nelson Muntz,"Careful, boys. It took me months to steal that bumper."
Voice From Trunk,Help! Help!
Bart Simpson,What was that?
Nelson Muntz,You didn't hear nothin'.
Homer Simpson,Are you nervous son?
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, Dad, as three time Soap Box derby champion Ronnie Beck says, ""Gravity is my co-pilot."""
Weasel #1,"Hey boss, just in case you need it."
Nelson Muntz,Thanks guys.
Nelson Muntz,Now get out of here.
Martin Prince,Oh my. I didn't realize this hill was so high. Could I have another minute -- Aaah!
Martin Prince,Aieee!
Martin Prince,"Deploy, damn you, deploy!"
,
Martin Prince,It hurts! It hurts! Owee-owee-owee-ow!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Young man, I'm afraid this stress fracture will require you to be in a cast for six weeks."
Martin Prince,But that means I can't possibly race!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Son, you're lucky to be alive."
Martin Prince,"Save your palliative cliches for the next poor sap, Doctor."
Bart Simpson,Is it okay to visit?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Of course.
Bart Simpson,"Hey man, cool crash. Way to cheat death."
Martin Prince,"Thanks, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"You had the best stick out there, man. I wish I could build 'em like you."
Martin Prince,That racer transformed me into the twisted creature you see before you. I'll never race again.
Bart Simpson,"If you don't race, then Nelson'll win!"
Martin Prince,"Even if I wanted to, I'm in no shape to do it. Unless... Bart, will you drive my car?"
Bart Simpson,"Oh, I don't know if I should do that. My dad and I built our car together and if I drove someone else's it'd kill him. On the other hand... I'll do it."
,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks..."
Bart Simpson,"Dad... I don't know how to say this, but I don't want to drive your car. It's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart..."
Homer Simpson,"Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we're Team Simpson."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win."
Homer Simpson,When did I ever teach you that?
Bart Simpson,"Well, I picked it up somewhere. And if I drive Martin's car I can win. I'm sorry, but..."
Homer Simpson,"Don't be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad."
Homer Simpson,"I'll just sit here in ""Li'l Lightnin'"" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son."
Homer Simpson,Ow.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, can you take me to Dr. Hibbert's office?"
Homer Simpson,Why? What's wrong?
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, nothing. I just scheduled a tetanus booster. Maybe I'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn't it, Lisa?"
,
Homer Simpson,
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Martin, your bone is healing nicely."
Martin Prince,Tell me something I don't know.
Homer Simpson,"Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker!"
Moe Szyslak,Figure of speech.
Martin Prince,"Mr. Simpson, you have every right to be angry. But rest assured, your son loves you..."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,You certainly gave that boy the heebie-jeebies.
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, aren't you coming?"
Homer Simpson,No!
Marge Simpson,"Now, don't pout."
Homer Simpson,"I'm not pouting, you are."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, you gotta come. I just got your hat out of the fridge."
Homer Simpson,Sorry.
Marge Simpson,Don't you at least have something to say to Bart?
Homer Simpson,No. Can't think of a thing.
Marge Simpson,Homer! I've always said you were a good father. I've always defended you when people put you down.
Selma Bouvier,That's for sure.
Patty Bouvier,She ain't lyin'.
Marge Simpson,But I guess I was wrong. You are a bad father.
Homer Simpson,Leave me alone.
British Commentator,"Good morning, everybody, and welcome to an event that harkens back to the carefree days of the Great Depression -- The Soapbox Derby."
British Commentator,"In just minutes, these junior Al Unser Juniors will lock horns."
Homer Simpson,"Name your son's hobbies. Building a soapbox racer... ""Name your child's friends."" Martin... Martin! I'll curse that name 'til the day I die... Huh? ""Who is your son's heroe?""..."
Homer Simpson,Three-time Soapbox Derby Champion Ronnie Beck!
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I'm one question away from being a perfect father. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
Ned Flanders,Hey ho Simpson.
Homer Simpson,Shut up Flanders. Flanders!
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, Flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating?"
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, there are two schools of thought..."
Homer Simpson,"Great, thanks."
Homer Simpson,"I talked to Flanders about parenting. I'm a perfect father. Hold on, son, I'm-a coming!"
,
Barney Gumble,My friend and I have a bet -- Are you Mary Tyler Moore?
Martin Prince,"Bart, if she breaks up on you, steer away from the grandstands, or else you might kill hundreds of innocent spectators. Bart what did I just tell you?"
Bart Simpson,Kill spectators.
Martin Prince,What is the matter with you?
Bart Simpson,"It's my dad. Lying there on the couch drinking a beer, staring at the TV. I've never seen him like that."
Martin Prince,Forget about your father. You're driving for me now!
Homer Simpson,"Do it for your old man, boy!"
Nelson Muntz,"Simpson, prepare to die."
Bart Simpson,Let's rock.
P.A. Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, to drop the checkered flag, our beloved Mayor, Diamond Joe Quimby."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"To everyone participating today, I salute your vigor. Check out the rack on the blonde in the fourth row."
British Commentator,"... like the arrogant Roman and Judah Ben Hur, these modern charioteers battle ferociously. No quarter given, none asked."
British Commentator,The world has not seen the likes of this since the French carried Lucky Lindy off on their shoulders from Le Bourget Field.
P.A. Announcer,"And now, to present the trophy, three time Soapbox Derby Champion, Ronnie Beck."
Ronnie,Congratulations Bart. Seeing you out there brought back a lot of memories.
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Mr. Beck. I was alone out there, but someone was riding with me in spirit... This is for you, Dad."
,
Martin Prince,"I might remind you both, I did design that racer. The driver is essentially ballast."
Nelson Muntz,"The better man won, Simpson. You can really drive."
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Nelson, put her there."
Bart Simpson,Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Loser! Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!
Marge Simpson,"Bart, you know there is such a thing as being a bad winner."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I never won before. I may never win again. Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!"
Homer Simpson,"That's my boy. Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!"
Bart Simpson,"Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!"
,
Kent Brockman,"Hello, I'm Kent Brockman and this is Eye on Springfield."
,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, infotainment."
Kent Brockman,"Tonight, we solute the silver anniversary of the great Springfield tire yard fire. Twenty-five years and stilll burning strong."
Kent Brockman,...We watch Springfield's oldest man meet Springfield's fattest man...
Homer Simpson,He's not so fat.
Kent Brockman,"And we visit with Heavyweight Champion, Drederick Tatum, who reminisces about growing up in Springfield."
DREDERICK,"That town is a dump. If you ever see me back there, you know I really up bad."
Kent Brockman,"But first, part seven of our eye-opening look at... the bikini!"
Bart Simpson,"Whoa, T and A."
Homer Simpson,"Bart, why are you still up?"
Bart Simpson,Lisa's slumber party.
Bart Simpson,Who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me?
Homer Simpson,"Boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. Sheesh, what an ego."
JANEY,"Lisa, your brother is so gross!"
Lisa Simpson,You should smell his room.
JANEY,"Now remember, Wanda, whatever shape the wax takes, that's what your husband's job will be."
Wanda,It's a mop. My husband will be a janitor.
Lisa Simpson,That looks like an Olympic torch to me. Your husband could be an Olympic athlete who will go on to have a great acting career.
Wanda,It's a dustpan.
Lisa Simpson,The wax never lies.
Becky,Let's play truth or dare.
Girls,"Truth or dare, truth or dare."
Becky,"I'll take -- ""dare""."
JANEY,I dare you to -- kiss Lisa's brother.
Girls,Eeeeeewwwwww!
Bart Simpson,What the... ?
Bart Simpson,Aaahhh!
Bart Simpson,Ptew!! Ptew!! I'm telling Mom and Dad.
Lisa Simpson,You're telling who?
Becky,Mom and Dad!
Girls,Jinx!
JANEY,Now you can't talk until somebody says your name!
Kent Brockman,"Coming up next, an elephant who never forgets... to brush!"
Homer Simpson,"What is it, boy?"
Homer Simpson,"Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man."
Homer Simpson,"Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad?"
Bart Simpson,"Because I'm ""jinxed"" dammit!"
Bart Simpson,Ow! What was that for?
Homer Simpson,"You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you in the arm. Sorry, it's the law. Heh, heh."
JANEY,There he is! Let's give him a make-over.
Homer Simpson,Run for it boy!
Lisa Simpson,"Come here, Maggie."
Homer Simpson,That's it. I'm outta here.
,
Moe Szyslak,"Hiya, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"What's the matter, Moe?"
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, business is slow. People today are healthier and drinking less. You know, if it wasn't for the Junior High school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, things are tough all over."
Moe Szyslak,Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.
Homer Simpson,Could I get a beer?
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, yeah, sure."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh sorry, I forgot we're out of beer."
Homer Simpson,
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I know, I got behind on my beer payments. The distributor cut me off and I spent my last ten grand on the ""Love Tester""."
Moe Szyslak,"You're too late, Homer. Barney sucked it dry. Cut his gums up pretty bad."
Homer Simpson,
Moe Szyslak,"Take it easy, Homer. I learned how to make other drinks at Bartender's School."
Moe Szyslak,Gin and... tonic? Do they mix?
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself..."
,
Homer Simpson,One night Marge's beastly sisters were showing slides from their latest vacation.
Selma Bouvier,... and this is Patty trying to plug her leg razor into one of those ungodly Czechoslovakian outlets.
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Harv."
Selma Bouvier,"As you can see, we never did get the hang of it."
Bart Simpson,Aye carumba!
Homer Simpson,"As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink."
Homer Simpson,"Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment?"
Patty Bouvier,"If you're going for a beer, this is the last one."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.
Homer Simpson,In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids' cough syrup.
Homer Simpson,It passed the first test: I didn't go blind.
Patty Bouvier,"They say everyone can float in the Dead Sea, but Selma sank right to the bottom."
Homer Simpson,"I don't know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good."
,
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, sounds like one hell of a drink. What do you call it?"
Homer Simpson,"A ""Flaming Homer""."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, why don't you make us up a couple of ""Flaming Homers""?"
Homer Simpson,"Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, let me check the lost and found."
Moe Szyslak,"What do we got here, Bowie knife, troll doll, glass eye..."
Moe Szyslak,Oh. Here we are.
Moe Szyslak,It's not without its charm.
Homer Simpson,Try lighting it on fire.
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa! Homer, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited."
Larry,"Hey, your Love Tester's busted. I want my nickel back."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, buddy. Have one on the house."
Larry,"Hey, hey, this drink is delicious! And my phlegm feels looser. What do you call it?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's called a ""Flaming..."
Moe Szyslak,"Moe! It's called a ""Flaming Moe""! That's right, a ""Flaming Moe"". My name is Moe, and I invented it. That's why it's called a Flaming Moe. What? What are you lookin' at, Homer? It's a Flaming Moe I'm Moe."
Barney Gumble,"Hey, what's this?"
Moe Szyslak,A sneeze guard.
Barney Gumble,"Wow, it really works."
HARV,I'll be back.
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it?"
Moe Szyslak,Who can say? It's probably a combination of things.
Patron #1,"Another pitcher of those amazing ""Flaming Moe's""."
Patron #2,"Boy, I hate this joint, but I love that drink."
Collette,"Barkeep, I couldn't help noticing your sign."
Moe Szyslak,"The one that says, ""Bartenders Do It 'Til You Barf""?"
Collette,"No, above that store-bought drollery."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh great! Why don't we fill out an application? I'll need your name, measurements and turn ons.."
Collette,You really expect me to tell you my measurements?
Moe Szyslak,"You could, but I find this way is much more accurate... and fun."
Collette,what do you offer in the way of salary?
Moe Szyslak,Minimum wage and tips. Of course there are fringe benefits.
Collette,Such as?
Moe Szyslak,An unforgettable weekend at Club Moe.
Collette,I prefer to take my vacations someplace hot.
Moe Szyslak,"I like your moxie, kid. You're hired."
Collette,You shan't regret this.
Moe Szyslak,Methinks I shan't.
HARV,"Pardon me, are you the genius behind the ""Flaming Moe""?"
Homer Simpson,Why yes I --
Moe Szyslak,I'm your man.
HARV,"Huh uh. My name is Harv Bannister. I work for ""Tipsy McStagger's Good Time Drinking and Eating Emporium""."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh yeah? Hey, what's Mr. McStagger really like?"
HARV,"Actually, there is no Tipsy McStagger. He's just a composite of other successful logos."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, you tell him from me that he makes one great mozzarella stick."
HARV,"Yes, fine, I will. Anyway, I've got a proposition for you."
Moe Szyslak,Keep talkin'.
HARV,"We feel your ""Flaming Moe"" is perfect for our restaurant chain. We want to buy the recipe."
Moe Szyslak,"No dice. The ""Flaming Moe"" is not for sale. Do you know how much of my blood and sweat are in this drink?"
Barney Gumble,"Good for you, Moe. Only an idiot would give away a million dollar idea like that."
Homer Simpson,

Martin Prince,"So the next time you use a gas chromatograph, remember to thank Mister A.J.P Martin."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Brilliant Martin, brilliant. Once again you've wrecked the grading curve. Oh, I pity the poor student who has to follow you. Bart Simpson? You're next."
Bart Simpson,"""The Inventor I Admire"", by Bart Simpson. The inventor I admire is, not a rich man, or a famous man, or even a smart man. He's my father, Homer Simpson, creator of... the ""Flaming Homer""!"
Nelson Muntz,"The ""Flaming Homer""? You mean the ""Flaming Moe"". And your dad didn't invent it, ya wuss. Moe the bartender did."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Yes, everyone knows that."
Bart Simpson,"It's not true! My father invented that drink, and if you'll allow me to demonstrate..."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Bart, are those liquor bottles?"
Bart Simpson,I brought enough for everybody.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Take those to the teacher's lounge. You can have what's left at the end of the day.
Bernard,"Good evening, Krusty."
Krusty the Clown,"Nice to see you, Bernard."
Bernard,Thank you very much. Right this way.
Photographer,"Krusty, over here!"
Krusty the Clown,What the--?

Aide,"Uh, sir, this is already Veteran's Day."
Mayor Joe Quimby,It can be two things!
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, instead of milk for dinner, can I have a ""Virgin Moe?"""
Marge Simpson,"Honey, what's wrong?"
Homer Simpson,I'll tell you what's wrong. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him!
Homer Simpson,Take that off this second!
Bart Simpson,Okay.
Marge Simpson,"Homie, why don't you just go down to Moe's and talk to him? I bet he'd be willing to share some of his success with you."
,
,
Bernard,Can I help you sir?
Homer Simpson,I need to talk to Moe.
Bernard,Your name's not on the list.
Homer Simpson,I didn't even tell you my name.
Bernard,"Okay, what's your name?"
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson.
Bernard,Not on the list.
Homer Simpson,But--
Bernard,We're all filled up. Fire laws.
Moe Szyslak,"Ladies and gentlemen, some new buddies of mine stopped by tonight. Maybe we can get 'em to come up here. How about a warm ""Flaming Moe's"" welcome for Aerosmith!"
Aerosmith,"I don't think so, Moe. / Yeah, we're just hangin' out."
Moe Szyslak,"C'mon, guys. Free pickled eggs."
Steven Tyler,"Hello, St. Lewis!"

Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Hiya, Scrumptious. Do you want to ignite my drink?"
Homer Simpson,You're my kid's teacher!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Single parent, are we?"
Homer Simpson,No!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Well, let's pretend you are."
Homer Simpson,Get away from me.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Moe?"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, hiya, Homer. How 'bout a beer?"
Homer Simpson,"I'd rather have a ""Flaming Homer""."
Moe Szyslak,"A what? Oh, I get it."
Homer Simpson,"How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was going under and it was the drink I invented that saved it."
Homer Simpson,"If there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise."
Collette,"Morris, is what this man's saying true?"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, it's hard to say. He may have come up with the recipe, but I came up with the idea of charging six ninety-five for it."
Moe Szyslak,"Whoop, telephone."
Moe Szyslak,Flaming Moe's.
Bart Simpson,"Uh, yes, I'm looking for a friend of mine. Last name Jass, first name Hugh."
Moe Szyslak,"Hold on. I'll check. Hugh Jass, Oh, somebody check the men's room for a Hugh Jass."
HUGH,"Oh, I'm Hugh Jass."
Moe Szyslak,Telephone.
HUGH,"Hello, this is Hugh Jass."
Bart Simpson,Uh... hi.
HUGH,Who's this?
Bart Simpson,Bart Simpson.
HUGH,"What can I do for you, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,"Uh, look. I'll level with you, mister. This is a crank call that sorta backfired and I'd like to bail out right now."
HUGH,All right. Better luck next time. What a nice young man.
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, I'm sorry you're mad at me, but this isn't personal. This is business."
Homer Simpson,"Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. You just lost yourself a customer!"
Moe Szyslak,"What? I'm sorry. Homer, I couldn't hear you."
Homer Simpson,"I said, you just lost yourself a customer!"
Moe Szyslak,What?
Homer Simpson,You just lost yourself a customer.
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, you're gonna have to speak up!"
Homer Simpson,"You just lost yourself a customer, Moe!"
Moe Szyslak,I lost myself to what?

Moe Szyslak,"Hey, there. What can I do for ya, Harv?"
HARV,"Well sir, Tipsy McStagger would like to buy your drink."
Moe Szyslak,He's here?!
HARV,"Oh, no, no. I mean my company is willing to do what it takes to get that recipe. We're prepared to offer you one million dollars."
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Harv, but like I told you before, it ain't for sale."
HARV,Don't be stupid. We have a laboratory for this kind of thing. We've got it all figured out except for one ingredient.
,
Professor Jonathan Frink,Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph... the secret ingredient is... love? Who's been screwing with this thing?
,
Moe Szyslak,"I'm sorry, but the secret ingredient dies with me."
Delivery Man,Thirty cases of cough syrup. Sign here.
Moe Szyslak,I got hooked on this stuff in the service.

Homer Simpson,"Ah, my new watering hole."

Marge Simpson,"So, Mr. Hutz, does my husband have a case?"
Lionel Hutz,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Simpson, but you can't copyright a drink."
Homer Simpson,
Lionel Hutz,"Well, this all goes back to the Frank Wallbanger case of '78. How about that? I looked something up! These books behind me don't just make the office look good, they're filled with useful legal tidbits just like that!"
,
Homer Simpson,Stupid Moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing... pug-nosed...
Marge Simpson,"Well Homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy."
Homer Simpson,"Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic."
Marge Simpson,"Well, duh."
,
Moe Szyslak,"Now that's what I call a ""Happy Hour""."
Collette,Morris something troubles me.
Moe Szyslak,"Don't worry baby, my mother won't be home for another twenty minutes."
Collette,"No, I was just thinking about Homer Simpson."
Moe Szyslak,"That's okay, I was just thinking about Sybil Danning."
Collette,I meant I think you should sell your drink and give half the money to Homer.
Moe Szyslak,But honey --
Collette,"He's your friend, Morris. And you took advantage of him."
Moe Szyslak,"Alright, alright. I'll split the million with Homer. Jeepers, Mary and Joseph. I sleep with a chick once, it costs me a half a million bananas."
,
Homer Simpson,Moe... Moe... Moe...
Marge Simpson,"Bart, are you going to moe the lawn today?"
Bart Simpson,"Okay, but you promised me moe money."
Marge Simpson,"I moe, I moe."
Homer Simpson,Moe... Moe... Moe.
Lisa Simpson,"When Bart's done, can we moe to the moevies? There's a moetinee."
Marge Simpson,Of course. All work and moe play makes Moe a moe moe.
Homer Simpson,"Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe..."
Flowers,"Hey, Homer. Whatsamatter?"
,
Tom Hamilton,"Hey, where's Joey?"
Joey Kramer,"Mrs. Krabappel, I really need my drum sticks."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Come and get 'em.
HARV,"You're gonna be a rich man, Moe. I gotta tell you, the way we usually work in these situations is to steal the recipe and run the inventor out of business. C'est la vie."
Moe Szyslak,What the...
Homer Simpson,"Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your Flaming Moe's. All the time wondering, ""How does he do it?"" Well, I'm going tell you. The secret ingredient is..."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, no!"
Homer Simpson,"Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children's cough syrup!"
Moe Szyslak,Shoot.
HARV,"Thank you, Mr. Nutball. Gotta go, Moe. Tough luck."
Barney Gumble,Holy cow. You just fell on Aerosmith!

Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Homer, come in here."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Moe. Where's that waitress of yours?"
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, she left to pursue a movie career. Frankly I think she was better off here."
Homer Simpson,"Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, hey, hey. Maybe some things are too good to be kept a secret."
Homer Simpson,I guess so.
Moe Szyslak,"Compliments of the house. One ""Flaming Homer""."
Homer Simpson,"Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You're the greatest friend a guy could ever have."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight?"
Moe Szyslak,I doubt it.

Waylon Smithers,"It's a breakthrough product, sir: scientifically formulated to rinse clean with no oily deposits."
C. Montgomery Burns,Hot dog!
,
Waylon Smithers,And it's mild enough to use every day.
C. Montgomery Burns,Isn't life grand?
Waylon Smithers,"What's wrong sir, did I get some in your eyes? The shampoo specifically said ""No More Tears""."
C. Montgomery Burns,"A lovely promise, but one beyond the powers of a mere shampoo."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, I feel there is something you're not telling me? Perhaps, you'd feel more comfortable talking to Snappy the Alligator."
C. Montgomery Burns,Maybe.
Waylon Smithers,"Hello, Mr. Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Snappy, do you it's hard to imagine, but I was once a barefoot boy with cheek of tan. I dreamed of grand slam homeruns and wiping out nations with the stroke of a pen."
Snappy,"Well there's still time for all those things, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Is there? Controlled nuclear fission is a demanding mistress, Snappy."
Snappy,So you feel resentful towards the plant.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, yes, exactly! You know, maybe it's time I sold the old girl."
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what do they want!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Maybe a nap will boost my spirits.
Waylon Smithers,"I'll get that whale song cassette that you like, sir."
Homer Simpson,It's not fair!
Waylon Smithers,"I know how you feel, Simpson. I've never seen Mr. Burns so depressed."
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.
Waylon Smithers,"People think that because he's rich and powerful and cruel, he doesn't have feelings like other men. But he does. And you know what? I bet he wouldn't sell the plant for a hundred million dollars."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, that's a lot of money."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Mr. Smithers, do you have change for a dollar?"
Waylon Smithers,"Good, good. Try to eat something."
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson here.
Moe Szyslak,Are you sure? Cuz once I open the bottle there's no refund.
Broker,"Homer, it's your stockbroker. Your stock in the power plant just went up for the first time in ten years."
Homer Simpson,I own stock?
Broker,"Yes, all the employees got some in exchange for waiving certain constitutional rights."
Homer Simpson,"So uh, how much did it go up?"
Broker,Wait a minute. Let's not do that yet. The book says we have to make a little small talk before you get down to business. Everybody alive?
Homer Simpson,Yeah...
Broker,Like any sports?
Homer Simpson,Sure...
Broker,Ever go dancing?
Homer Simpson,Not any more...
Broker,We should get together sometime.
Homer Simpson,That'd be great.
Broker,There. Now we trust each other.
Homer Simpson,Well... how are you?
Broker,Near death. I'm renewing my notary license on a weekly basis.
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh. So what's my stock up to?
Broker,Let me punch that up on the computer.
Broker,Twenty five cents a share.
Homer Simpson,What should I do?
Broker,"Well, let me put it this way. You'll get twenty-five dollars if you sell now."
Homer Simpson,Sell! Sell! Sell! Woo hoo! Twenty-five dollars!
Homer Simpson,"Ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer..."
,
Marge Simpson,Bart! Bart! Turn to the financial channel! Aunt Patty says our stock is skyrocketing!
Scott Christian,Unconfirmed takeover rumors have pushed Burns Worldwide from one eighth to fifty-two and a quarter...
Marge Simpson,Your father's stock is worth fifty-two hundred dollars!
Bart Simpson,"Wow, fifty-two hundred smackers."
Bart Simpson,
,
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Homer. Wanna Duff?"
Homer Simpson,"No, I'd like a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve."
,
Homer Simpson,"For your information, I just made a cool twenty-five dollars playing the market. Buy low, sell high, that's my motto. I may just quit my job at the power plant to become a full-time stock market guy."
Homer Simpson,"Have a Duff, boys!"
Hans,"Oh, thank you. My English is not perfect, but I have to tell you your beer is like swill to us. Do I have that right? I am saying that only a swine would drink this beer."
Fritz,"Yeah, but thank you anyway."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?"
Hans,"Ech, nein. We are from Germany. He is from the East. I am from the West."
Fritz,I had a big company and he had a big company. Now we have a very big company.
Hans,We are interested in buying the power plant. Do you think the owner would ever sell it?
Homer Simpson,"Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars."
Fritz,A hundred million?
Hans,"Oh, don't worry! We'll still have enough left to buy the Cleveland Browns."
,
Marge Simpson,It's the miracle we've been waiting for.
Bart Simpson,What are we going to spend it on?
Patty Bouvier,Homer's probably buying some magic beans with it right now.
Marge Simpson,"We'll have a savings account. We've never had one. Kids, I think everything is going to be okay from now on."
Homer Simpson,Hey... hey!
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer!"
Homer Simpson,You heard?
Marge Simpson,We heard! Isn't it wonderful? We have some great plans for that money.
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm afraid I had some great plans, too."
Marge Simpson,What do you mean?
Homer Simpson,I spent it on beer.
Selma Bouvier,Surprise surprise.
Marge Simpson,You spent fifty-two hundred dollars on beer?
Homer Simpson,Fifty-two hundred dollars? What are you talking about?
Homer Simpson,What? I sold it all for twenty-five bucks.
Homer Simpson,Ow!
Bart Simpson,Come on everybody. It makes you feel better.
Carl Carlson,"Hey, Homer."
Homer Simpson,Did you buy this car with your stock money?
Carl Carlson,"Sure did. And the great thing about it is everybody got rich. For once, all us working stiffs got a break."
Homer Simpson,
Charlie,"Hey, wait till you see Lenny. He just got back from the plastic surgeon."
Carl Carlson,"Jeez Lenny, looks like you got the works."
Lenny Leonard,"Well it started out as an eye tuck, but the stock kept going up."
Worker,"Hey, come here, Mr. Burns is on TV."
Kent Brockman,"Mr. Burns, we've heard that a German consortium has offered to purchase the plant. Any comment?"
C. Montgomery Burns,You'll see the Statue of Liberty wearing lederhosen before you see Germans running my plant!
Kent Brockman,"Well then, sir, why are you meeting with them?"
C. Montgomery Burns,So I can look Uncle Fritz square in the monocle and say nein.
,
Waylon Smithers,"Ah, you never cease to amaze me, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Whoo! oooh, oooh, Whooo hoo hoo!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I grudgingly accept.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, don't worry. I think you'll find that these two gentlemen are as American as apple pie! Hans and Fritz, well that's just John and Frank!"
Mayor Joe Quimby,Ich bin ein Springfielder!
Homer Simpson,We could all lose our jobs.
Marge Simpson,Look at all those worried faces -- except for Lenny. He looks great.
Lenny Leonard,This is the worst day of my life.
Lenny Leonard,Those lousy Germans can't fire me. I'm the only one who knows how to unjam the rod bottom dissociator.
Carl Carlson,"Well, they can't fire me. I'm the only one certified to run the gaseous contaminant particularfier."
Homer Simpson,"Well, they can't fire me."
Carl Carlson,Why?
Homer Simpson,Cuz... I...
Lisa Simpson,"Well, it's a country in Europe --"
Horst,"Guten morgen, I am Horst. The new owners have elected me to speak with you because I am the most nonthreatening. Perhaps I remind you of the lovable Sergeant Schultz on Hogan's Heroes."
,
,
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, he does."
Horst,What is the best way to an efficient plant?
Horst,Happy workers who feel secure at their jobs. So let's get to know each other better. Do we have any alcoholics among us?
Horst,"You'll be given a six-week treatment at our drying out facility in Hawaii, after which you'll return at full pay."
Homer Simpson,Lucky drunks.
Horst,"Also, we cannot uber-emphasize the importance of employee safety."
Horst,We plan to have some frank discussions with your safety inspector.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah! Sock it to him, Horst!"
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, Homer, aren't you the safety inspector?"
Homer Simpson,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,That's one big check.
German Teacher,"You look sharp today, sir. You looken sharpen todayen, mein herr."
Waylon Smithers,"You looken sharpen todayen, mein herr."
German Teacher,"That was a gutsy decision, sir. Ein wassen das gutsy decisionen, mein herr."
Waylon Smithers,Ein wassen das...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers! Come here, I want you."
C. Montgomery Burns,I wanted to give you something to remember me by. I know you've always had your eye on this photo of Elvis and me.
Waylon Smithers,"He was so good to his mother, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, but I couldn't understand a word that man said. Misht Burnsh, dajna boo mafrn friszner... er hound-dog."
Waylon Smithers,"Stop it, you're killing me sir."
Waylon Smithers,"Oh sir, what will you do next?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, first I'll get that new hip I've been hankering for. Then, who knows? Bee keeping, boxing, bache ball?... The world is my oyster, Smithers. Farewell!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, your father needs your help. Do you know anything about Germany?"
Homer Simpson,"Good, good, I'm learning."
Lisa Simpson,One of the economic powers of the world--
Homer Simpson,Because we send them money?
Lisa Simpson,"No. Because they're efficient and punctual, with a strong work ethic."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, woa is me."
Marge Simpson,"Homie, come to bed."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, I'm gonna be fired. I know it."
Marge Simpson,"Don't worry. Whatever happens, we'll pay the bills somehow."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's not the money. My job is my identity. If I'm not a safety whatchamajigger, I'm nothing."
Marge Simpson,"Well, if you can't sleep, why don't you do something constructive?"
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, Battlestar Galactica."
Homer Simpson,"Fit, damn you! Fit!"
Homer Simpson,There.
Bart Simpson,"Yo, Homer. You gotta get ready for work."
Homer Simpson,Huh? What?
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what am I gonna... Hey, you! top being so unsafe! Smitty -- safen-up!"
Horst,"Homer, could we have a word with you?"
Homer Simpson,No.
Horst,"I must have phrased that badly. My English is, how you say... inelegant. I meant to say, may we have a brief, friendly chat?"
Homer Simpson,No!
Horst,"Once again, I have failed."
,
Homer Simpson,Auugghh!
Horst,You've been safety inspector for two years. What initiatives have you spearheaded in that time?
Homer Simpson,Uh... all of them?
Horst,I see. Then you must have some good ideas for the future as well.
Homer Simpson,I sure do!
Fritz,Such as...
Homer Simpson,"Well, ah, I wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy."
C. Montgomery Burns,This is my park! Get out!
Horst,"We understand Homer. After all, we are from the land of chocolate."
Homer Simpson,Mmm. The land of chocolate...
,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Chocolate -- half price!
,
Homer Simpson,La la la la la...
Fritz,Mr. Simpson...
Homer Simpson,La la la la la la...
Fritz,Mr. Simpson...
Homer Simpson,"Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry. We were talking about chocolate?"
Horst,That was ten minutes ago!
Homer Simpson,I think I did pretty good in there.
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, you know those Germans aren't so bad."
Lenny Leonard,"Sure, they've made mistakes in the past, but that's why pencils have erasers."
Horst,Attention workers. We have completed our evaluation of the plant.
Horst,"We regret to announce the following lay-offs, which I will read in alphabetical order. Simpson, Homer. That is all."
,
Bart Simpson,Aye carumba!
Marge Simpson,"Now, Bart, Lisa did a wonderful job on my hair and we saved forty dollars for the family. We all have to pull together 'til your father gets a new job."
Lisa Simpson,I made a new bar of soap by squeezing all our little soap slivers together.
Marge Simpson,That's very clever.
Bart Simpson,"And today, instead of buying comic books, I just read 'em and left 'em in the store."
Marge Simpson,"Hmmm, you shouldn't do that."
Lisa Simpson,"My jump rope broke, but I just tied it back together."
Marge Simpson,"That's good, Lisa."
Bart Simpson,I didn't take a bath today and I may not take one tomorrow.
Marge Simpson,"I want you to take baths, Bart."
Homer Simpson,"Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say I'm not safe? Oh what's the matter with this thing."
Homer Simpson,No problems here.
Jasper Beardly,"That's right, Burnsie... keep your wrist supple... throw it, don't aim it..."
Grampa Simpson,It was worth it.
Waylon Smithers,"This place has really gone to hell, Mr. Burns. It's obscene what they did to your office."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Listen, Smithers, you caught me at a bad time but my folk guitar class has been canceled for tonight. Would you like to get together for a drink?"
Waylon Smithers,Would I!
C. Montgomery Burns,Fine. I gotta go. See you at six.
C. Montgomery Burns,"You're going down, my friend."
Boxer,"Yes sir, Mr. Burns."
Horst,That shouldn't be.
Horst,Raccoons!
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's right... gather the nectar, my little drones, and make the honey. Honey for your children."
C. Montgomery Burns,Fools!
Waylon Smithers,"Ready for that drink, sir?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Just a second, Smithers. Let me introduce you to the gang. That's Buzz. That's Honey. And you see that queen over there? Her name is ""Smithers."""
Waylon Smithers,"Ha, ha. That's very flattering, sir. But we should go. Several bees are stinging me."
,
Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking.
Bart Simpson,"Uh yes, I'm looking for a Mrs. O'Problem. First name... Bee."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, yeah. Just a minute, I'll check. Uh, Bee O'Problem. Bee O'Problem. C'mon, guys. Do I have an O'Problem here?"
Barney Gumble,You sure do!
Moe Szyslak,"Awwww. It's you, isn't it?"
Bart Simpson,
Moe Szyslak,"Listen you, when I get a hold of you, I'm gonna use your head for a bucket and paint my house with your brains!"
Bart Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Bart, I want you to go down to Moe's Tavern. I need you to bring your father home."
Bart Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,"Excuse me, I'm looking for --"
Moe Szyslak,Wait a minute. I know that voice.
Moe Szyslak,If it isn't little Bart Simpson! I haven't seen you in years.
Bart Simpson,That's right. That's my pop!
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, little Bart... we hear all about your monkeyshines."
Moe Szyslak,Bet you get into all kinds of trouble he don't even know about. Am I right? Huh? Am I right?
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, well, I make some crank phone calls."
Moe Szyslak,"That's great! Hey, would you sing that old song you used to sing for me?"
Bart Simpson,"Moe, for you... anything?"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look! A blue-collar bar! Oh, Smithers, let's go slumming!"
,
Bart Simpson,"EVERY TEDDY BEAR WHO'S BEEN GOOD IS SURE OF A TREAT TODAY/ THERE'S LOTS OF MARVELOUS THINGS TO EAT, AND WONDERFUL GAMES TO PLAY/ BENEATH THE TREES, WHERE NOBODY SEES/ THEY'LL HIDE AND SEEK AS LONG AS THEY PLEASE/ TODAY'S THE DAY THE TEDDY BEARS HAVE THEIR PICNIC!"
Moe Szyslak,"He's a pip, this one is!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, the mirthless laugh of the damned. Hold your nose, Smithers, we're going in!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Watch me blend in. Barkeep, some cheap domestic beer for me and my ""buddy"" here."
Homer Simpson,"I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, who is this saucy fellow?"
Waylon Smithers,"Homer Simpson, sir. Sector Sieben-gruben -- I mean, Sector 7G. Recently terminated."
Homer Simpson,That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.
Homer Simpson,Let me ask you something. Does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue?
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, no."
Homer Simpson,"And does it ever say, ""I love you?"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, it doesn't."
Homer Simpson,"Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old and you're ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea!"
Homer Simpson,Nobody loves you...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Good heavens, Smithers! They're not afraid of me anymore!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey Mr. Burns, did you get that letter I sent?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Letter? I don't recall any letter...
Bart Simpson,That's because I forgot to stamp it.
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, that kid slays me."
C. Montgomery Burns,That was no accident. Let's get out of here.
Homer Simpson,Na na na na / Na na na na /
Barflies,Hey hey hey / Goodbye -- Na na na na / na na na na / hey hey hey / goodbye...
C. Montgomery Burns,What good is money if you can't inspire terror in your fellow man? I've got to get my plant back!
,
Hans,Gott in himmel! Who'd have thought a nuclear plant could be such a deathtrap.
Fritz,It will cost us another hundred million just to bring it up to code.
C. Montgomery Burns,Please sell me my plant back! I'll pay anything.
Horst,"Isn't this a happy coincidence? You are desperate to buy, and we are desperate to sell."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Desperate, eh? Advantage, Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"This is my offer. I think you'll find it's most unfair, but those are the breaks."
Hans,"But Mr. Burns, this is half of what we paid you."
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's my final offer, take it or leave it."
Horst,"All right, Mr. Burns. You win. But beware. We Germans aren't all smiles and sunshine."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh, the Germans are mad at me. I'm so scared. Ooh, the Germans."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Uh-oh, the Germans are comin' to get me. Oh, don't let the Germans come after me... Oh no, the Germans are coming after me. Oh, no, they're so big and strong..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Get out! This is my office now! Get out!
C. Montgomery Burns,"You too. This is a place of business, not a Peewee flop house!"
Waylon Smithers,"Your orders, sir?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Restore my office. Cancel all repairs. And rehire that chap who sassed me in the bar.
Waylon Smithers,"Homer Simpson, but why?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers. I keep my friends close and my enemies even closer. He'll slowly regain his confidence as the months and years drift by, blissfully unaware that the sword of Damocles is dangling just above his head."
C. Montgomery Burns,And then one day... when he least expects it --
,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo! I got my job back!
,
Marge Simpson,"""Barnacle Bill's Home Pregnancy Test""? Homer, shouldn't we have gone with a better-known brand?"
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, this one came with a free corncob pipe."
Marge Simpson,"Okay, let's see... ""Ahoy maties! If the water turns blue, a baby for you. If purple ye see, no baby thar be""."
Homer Simpson,"Well, what color is it? Blue or purple?"
Marge Simpson,Pink.
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"""If ye test should fail, to a doctor set sail"". Well, I guess I'd better go see Dr. Hibbert."
Homer Simpson,"Oh honey, do you really think you're pregnant?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, I have the same nausea and craving for pancake mix I did with the other kids."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, and I have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating I always get."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I'll let you know."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Homer, how come Mom's going to the doctor?"
Lisa Simpson,Is anything wrong?
Homer Simpson,"No, everything's fine. Your mother uh, just, broke her leg."
Lisa Simpson,What?
Bart Simpson,I smell a bun in the oven.
Lisa Simpson,"Is Mom gonna have another baby, Dad?"
Homer Simpson,Maybe.
Bart Simpson,"You're a machine, Homer."
Lisa Simpson,Did you hear that Maggie? Another baby in the house.
Bart Simpson,"Ohhh, cool, we can race them."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, sure, for you a baby's all fun and games. For me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings."
Lisa Simpson,Doesn't Mom do that stuff?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but I have to hear about it."
Bart Simpson,Were you like this when Mom was pregnant with me?
Homer Simpson,"Actually, Bart, I threw up more than your mother. ... It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80s."
Marge Simpson,"Hmmm, what do you think about?"
Homer Simpson,"Those were idealistic days... The candidacy of John Anderson, the rise of Supertramp... It was an exciting time to be young!"
,
Homer Simpson,For several years I'd been dating your mother and working at the local fun center.
Mr. Thorson,"Homer, you're turning the blades too fast. The golfers are complaining. Slow down!"
Mr. Thorson,"That's better. Ah, beautiful. Keep this up and someday you'll be the guy who hands out the putters."
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir."
,
Homer Simpson,"I was 24 years old, with a beautiful girlfriend and a job with a future..."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you're supposed to be listening to my story!"
Bart Simpson,"I thought it was over. You had a problem turning a blade, you overcame it. The feel-good story of the year."
Lisa Simpson,"It's not our fault our generation has short attention spans, Dad. We watch an appalling amount of TV."
Homer Simpson,"Don't you ever, ever talk that way about television. Lousy, ungrateful... Can't keep their, whaddyacallit... minds... on any uh..."
Homer Simpson,Where do you think you're going? You're gonna listen to my story.
Homer Simpson,Your mother was living with her two wicked sisters.
,
Mother,"Okay girls, you can smoke now."
Selma Bouvier,Umm... Oh yeah...
Marge Simpson,It's Homer!
Patty Bouvier,I don't know what you see in that ugly meatball.
Selma Bouvier,"Uh-huh. If you like being pawed by something fat and lazy, we could get a cat."
Mother,It would leave less hair on the couch.
Marge Simpson,You don't know Homer like I do. He's sensitive and sweet.
Marge Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, do you ever think about the future?"
Homer Simpson,You mean like will apes be our masters?
Marge Simpson,"No, I mean how you plan to earn a living. I can't imagine that job of yours is very stimulating."
Homer Simpson,But it gives me time to think.
Homer Simpson,"Well, girls I mean I mean boys. I, I mean you!"
Marge Simpson,"I think about you, too."
Homer Simpson,"Wow, what an ending? Who'd have thought Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're as pretty as Princess Leia and as smart as Yoda."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer."
,
Marge Simpson,YOU LIGHT UP MY DAYS / AND FILL MY NIGHTS / WITH SONG.... IT CAN'T BE WRONG / WHEN IT FEELS SO GOO/RIGHT / CAUSE YOU -- YOU
Marge Simpson,Our song.
Homer Simpson,I'll bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy.
Marge Simpson,"Actually, she was singing about God."
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well he's always happy. No, wait. He's always mad."
,
,
Homer Simpson,Someday I'll buy you a real castle.
Marge Simpson,You don't have to do that.
Homer Simpson,"Phew, good."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, maybe it's the Champale talking, but I think you're pretty sexy."
Homer Simpson,Really? It must be the Champale talking.
Marge Simpson,What if we get caught?
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. This castle is impregnable!
,
Homer Simpson,Pass the cookie dough.
Charlie,"Dust off your hula skirts, Angels, I'm afraid there's been a murder - in Hawaii!"

Marge Simpson,So You've Ruined Your Life.
,
Grampa Simpson,"Son, you gotta marry that girl!"
Homer Simpson,Because it's the honorable thing to do?
Grampa Simpson,"No, because you'll never do any better. You lucky bum! The fish jumped right in the boat. All you gotta do is whack her with the oar."
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, there's something I want to ask you. But I'm afraid, because if you say no it'll destroy me and make me a criminal."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I haven't said no to you lately, have I?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I... Damn it, where's that card?"
Marge Simpson,What card?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I wrote down what I was gonna say on a card. Stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket."
Marge Simpson,Is this it?
Homer Simpson,What's it say?
Marge Simpson,"""Marge, from the first moment I saw you I never wanted to be with anyone else. I don't have much to offer you... except all my love. Will you marry me?"""
Homer Simpson,That's the card. Give it here.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!"
Homer Simpson,So... will you marry me?
Marge Simpson,Yes.
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Woo hoo! Yeah! She's gonna marry me. In your face, everybody... Woo hoo!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, if the new baby is a girl, can we name her Ariel?"

Bart Simpson,Kool Moe Dee.
Lisa Simpson,Ariel.
Bart Simpson,Kool Moe Dee.
Homer Simpson,"You know, I had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago."
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I've been thinking. If the baby's a boy, what do you think of the name Larry?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we can't do that! All the kids'll call him Larry Fairy."
Marge Simpson,"Well, how about Louie?"
Homer Simpson,They'll call him Screwy Louie.
Marge Simpson,Bob?
Homer Simpson,Slob.
Marge Simpson,Luke?
Homer Simpson,Puke.
Marge Simpson,Marcus?
Homer Simpson,Mucous.
Marge Simpson,What about Bart?
Homer Simpson,"Let's see... Bart, Cart, Dart, Eeart... Nope, can't see any problem with that. Wow! I'll take that ring!"
Clerk,"Yes sir, and how will you be paying for it?"
Homer Simpson,I don't know.
,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, the big day came. We didn't have much money, so we went to a quaint little chapel just across the state line."
,
Lunchlady Doris,Basic ceremony's twenty bucks. Here's your license.
Lunchlady Doris,Be sure to get this punched every time. The tenth wedding is on the house.
Homer Simpson,Hey! This marriage is gonna last forever.
Lunchlady Doris,"No matter how many times I hear that, it always makes me laugh."
,
Justice Of The Peace,"Cletus, do you take Aline to be your lawful wedded wife?"
Groom,Yup.
Justice Of The Peace,Done. Next.
Marge Simpson,There certainly are a lot of stains on the ceiling.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm sorry. I wish I could afford a better place."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I'd be lying if I said that this is how I pictured my wedding day... But you are how I pictured my husband."
Homer Simpson,I am?
Marge Simpson,"Well, you may not look like Ted Bessell, but you're just as nice."
Homer Simpson,
Justice Of The Peace,"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God and this casino to join..."
Homer Simpson,Homer.
Justice Of The Peace,... and...
Marge Simpson,Marge.
Justice Of The Peace,... in holy matrimony. Beautiful.
Patty Bouvier,Don't be stupid.
Justice Of The Peace,"Do you, Marjorie Bouvier, take Homer J. Simpson to be your lawful wedded husband?"
Marge Simpson,I do.
Justice Of The Peace,"Homer, same question, names reversed."
Homer Simpson,I do.
Justice Of The Peace,"Then, by the power vested in me by the state gaming commission, I pronounce you man and wife. Here's ten dollars worth of chips, you may kiss the bride."
Justice Of The Peace,Next!

Homer Simpson,Pfft. Now you tell me.

Waylon Smithers,"Okay, that'll do."
Homer Simpson,... Little stuff starts disappearing from the workplace.

Homer Simpson,There's a problem with the reactor?! We're all gonna die!!!

Homer Simpson,
Repo Man,"Crib, mobile, monitor... oh, and the lady's ring, I'm afraid."
Marge Simpson,Oh dear...
Repo Man,Repossessing stuff is the hardest part of my job.
Homer Simpson,"""Dear Marge... By the time you read this, I will be gone. You deserve all the finest things in the world. And although I can give them to you, they will be repossessed and I will be hunted down like a dog. Also, it has become clear that your family doesn't want me here."""
Patty Bouvier,Shut up with that pen-scratching down there!
Homer Simpson,I will send you every cent I earn for the baby. But you will not see me again until I am a man.
,
Lisa Simpson,That is so sad.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, c'mon, honey. You know how it turns out. After all, you wouldn't be here today if I hadn't become the responsible head of a household."
Bart Simpson,"Hey Homer, can we have a can of frosting for lunch?"
Homer Simpson,Okay.
,
Marge Simpson,"""You will not see me again until I am a man."" Oh, Homer, Homer."

Homer Simpson,"No, Marge, I just can't. I mean, look at me. I'm a Trainee... They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. But I can't buy you a decent wedding ring."
Marge Simpson,Any ring is fine as long as it's from you.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, for you."
Marge Simpson,Aww...
Marge Simpson,Would you mind if I took it off now? The oil is burning my finger.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sure."

Marge Simpson,"No, because I love you."
Marge Simpson,Come home soon.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,That's it. That's it. Come closer...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ironic, isn't it. The hunter has become the hunted. Oh God, Smithers, I feel so alive."
Homer Simpson,You the boss?
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes.
Waylon Smithers,"I'll call security, sir."
Homer Simpson,Step aside! I'll deliver this baby!
Homer Simpson,"Well, listen to me, Mr. Bigshot... if you're looking for the kind of employee who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself... I'm your man. You can treat me like dirt and I'll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream. And if you don't like it... I can change!!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hold the phone, Smithers... I like your attitude. Feisty yet spineless."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, this man not only failed the aptitude test, he got trapped in a closet on his way out."
C. Montgomery Burns,I don't care. I haven't been this impressed since I first laid eyes on a young boot-lick named Waylon Smithers.
Homer Simpson,You mean?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Welcome aboard, son."
Homer Simpson,I got the job. I got the job! Whoo hoo! Only in America could I get a job!

Marge Simpson,"Homer, does this mean --"
Homer Simpson,"Starting tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician!"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Good God.
Homer Simpson,"And tomorrow morning, I'm gonna buy your ring back! Then I'm going house-hunting!"

Homer Simpson,"Hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me."

Marge Simpson,How could he? He's only ten minutes old.

Bart Simpson,Wha th...?
Patty Bouvier,It's a label maker.

Homer Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,What a crappy birthday.
Bart Simpson,"What do you mean, how did I get on the radio? I created the universe! Stupid kids."
Marge Simpson,"Y'know Bart, I don't think this is such a bad present. Maybe you just shouldn't talk into it as loud as your father does."
Marge Simpson,"Testing... testing... One, two, three... Oh, my. Do I sound like that?"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, it does work!"
Marge Simpson,I bet you could have a lot of fun with this. Why don't you go show your father?
Bart Simpson,Hmmm.

Milhouse Van Houten,Bravo!
Nelson Muntz,"Well done, old man."
,
Bart Simpson,Rod... Todd... this is God.
Rod Flanders,How did you get on the radio?
Todd Flanders,Forgive my brother. We believe you.
Bart Simpson,Talk is cheap. Perhaps a test of thy faith. Walk through the wall. I will remove it for you...later.
Todd Flanders,What do you want from us?
Bart Simpson,I got a job for thee. Bring forth all the cookies from your kitchen and leave them on the Simpsons porch.
Rod Flanders,But those cookies belong to our parents.
Bart Simpson,"Look, do you want a happy God or a vengeful God?"
Rod Flanders,Happy God.
Bart Simpson,Then quit flapping your lip and make with the cookies.
Todd Flanders,"Yes, sir."
,
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Whoops!
Bart Simpson,Help! Help!
Groundskeeper Willie,Hoot mon! Sounds like trouble a-brewin' at the old well.
Bart Simpson,"Help me, please! I fell down the well!"

Bart Simpson,Sucker.

Bart Simpson,Yes!

Bart Simpson,My name is Timmy O'Toole. I just turned ten years old.
Dave Shutton,"Timmy, where are your parents?"
Bart Simpson,"Uh... I have no family. I tried to enroll in school, but your Principal Skinner turned me away because of my shabby clothes."
Seymour Skinner,He's a liar!
Crowd,Booooooo!
Kent Brockman,"The circumference of the well is thirty-four inches. So, unfortunately, not one member of our city's police force is slender enough to rescue the boy."
Chief Wiggum,"By God, men -- you're a bunch of marshmallows!"
Fat Cop,"Why don't you go, Chief?"
Chief Wiggum,I'm too... important.
Lisa Simpson,Is it Sherri?
Kent Brockman,"Although the well is too dark to see the boy, Timmy has told us his foot is trapped under a rock. Thus, any attempt to pull him up would snap him like a twig."
Kent Brockman,"In desperation, the city is considering more unorthodox solutions."
Falcon Man,"Grasping the child firmly in his talons, Socrates here will fly him to safety! Just watch!"
Falcon Man,I don't think he's coming back.
Sailor,"With this hook, and this hunk of chocolate, I'll land your boy. And I'll clean him for free."
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Although we can't reach your boy, we can freeze him with liquid nitrogen so that future generations can rescue him."
,
Marge Simpson,"Dear Lord, before we peel the foil back from your bounty, we ask you to watch over little Timmy O'Toole, trapped in that well."
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Bart! What's wrong with you?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that Timmy is a real hero."
Lisa Simpson,"How do you mean, dad?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, he fell down a well... and can't get out..."
Lisa Simpson,How does that make him a hero?
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's more than you did!"
Kent Brockman,"And finally, Channel Six's own Krusty the Clown has gathered members of the entertainment community -- who normally steer clear of fashionable causes -- for a video called ""We're Sending Our Love Down The Well."""
Krusty the Clown,"I wanted to do something to help that boy. So I called my good friend Sting. He said, ""Krusty, when do you need me?"" I said Thursday -- he said, ""I'm busy Thursday"" -- I said, ""What about Friday?"" He said, ""Friday's worse than Thursday."" Then he said, ""How about Saturday?"" I said, ""Fine."" True story."
Sting,"Yeah, I used to open for Krusty in uh, '69. In fact, he fired me as I recall."
Krusty the Clown,Sting.
Sting,"But this isn't about show business. This is about some kid down a hole, or something, and we've all got to do what we can."
Sting,THERE'S A HOLE IN MY HEART / AS DEEP AS A WELL / FOR THAT POOR LITTLE BOY / WHO'S STUCK HALF-WAY TO HELL.
Sideshow Mel,THOUGH WE CAN'T GET HIM OUT / WE'LL DO THE NEXT BEST THING.
Groundskeeper Willie,Gas! Out of the hole!
Choir,AND WE'RE SENDING OUR LOVE DOWN THE WELL!
Krusty the Clown,ALL THE WAY DOWN.
Choir,WE'RE SENDING OUR LOVE DOWN THE WELL!
Krusty the Clown,DOWN THAT WELL!
Kent Brockman,"Krusty, what are your plans for the royalties?"
Krusty the Clown,"Well, we gotta pay for promotion, shipping, distribution... you know, those limos out back -- they aren't free... Whatever's left, we throw down the well."

Souvenir Hawker,Authentic Timmy O'Toole baby teeth! Six dollars a bag!
Bernard,Step to the rear... plenty of room in the back.
,
Lisa Simpson,Awww.
Bart Simpson,"Drop that microphone! Drop it, boy!"
Station Announcer,This is a special report from Channel Six news.
Kent Brockman,"Disturbing news from the old town well, where young Timmy O'Toole has apparently taken a turn for the worse."
Dr. Marvin Monroe,"I... a, it's very simple, Kent. The child is reverting to a feral, or wolf-like, state. Here's an artist's conception."
Lisa Simpson,Bart!
Bart Simpson,"I was trying to gnaw my foot off, but I couldn't get through my sock. Goodnight everybody."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart Simpson! The thought of a boy trapped in a well brought out the kindness and love of the entire community. When they find out you've been fooling them, they're gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors."
Bart Simpson,Oh yeah? And how are they gonna find out?
Lisa Simpson,The police will catch you sooner or later.
Bart Simpson,The police. They couldn't catch a cold.
Lisa Simpson,"Maybe not, but I bet you're stupid enough to have left a ""Property of Bart Simpson"" label on that radio."

Lou,"And Cinderella had the most beautiful gown at the ball. With eight satin petticoats, each more delicate than the last. I think he's asleep."
Eddie,Want to get a cup of coffee?
Lou,Okay. Brave little guy.
Eddie,"Hey, I almost tripped over this thing."
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,What did I do to deserve this?
Bart Simpson,Help! Help! I fell down the well.
Eddie,Tell us something we don't know.
Bart Simpson,No! My name is Bart Simpson!
Lou,What are you doing down there?
Bart Simpson,"Look, I'll level with you. There is no Timmy O'Toole. It was just a prank I was playing on everybody."
Lou,"Well, you sure fooled us, kid."
Eddie,"Hey, I got an idea for a prank. Let's go home and go to sleep. ."
Lou,"Good one, Eddie."
Bart Simpson,"Great joke, guys. Ha ha. Ha. Guys?"
,
Lou,So I'm afraid your son is trapped down the well.
Homer Simpson,You must think we're the worst parents in the world.
Eddie,"Yeah, that's... pretty much the feeling down at the station."
,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, son. Just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. I brought you your Krusty doll..."
Bart Simpson,Ow! Knock it off you bald boob!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, don't make me come down there!"
Bart Simpson,Like to see you fit.
Homer Simpson,"Why, you little --"
Mayor Joe Quimby,Put a man on him.
Old Lady #1,I liked the other boy. So polite.
Marge Simpson,What are you doing to save my baby boy?
Chief Wiggum,"Uh well, ma'am, we've located a piece of machinery in Shreveport, Louisiana, that could pop him out lickety-split."
Marge Simpson,"Well, why don't you get it?"
Chief Wiggum,"Well, I'm afraid we've got a budget problem, Mrs. Simpson. Your boy picked a bad time to fall down a well. Had he done it at the start of the fiscal year, no problemo."
Marge Simpson,You're telling me that the city won't pay to get a boy out of a well?
Chief Wiggum,"Well, they would have for Timmy. People loved that little guy. But your son, well, he kinda played us all for a bunch of saps."
Marge Simpson,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Gentlemen, this canary died of natural causes."
Groundskeeper Willie,Back in the hole!
Bart Simpson,No!
Kent Brockman,"So it seems we've all been the victims of a cruel hoax, perpetrated by a ten-year-old-hooligan. The time has come for finger-pointing. And most of them are squarely aimed at the boy's parents."
Homer Simpson,"It's not our fault. We didn't want the boy, he was an accident."
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,"Uh, could you edit that last part out?"
Kent Brockman,"Mr. Simpson, we're live coast-to-coast."
Homer Simpson,
Wanda,One plus one plus three is five/ Little Bart Simpson's buried alive / He's so neat / He's so sweet / Now the rats have Bart to eat.

JANEY,"How many days until Bart croaks. One, two, three, four..."
D.J.,"And our new number one hit, ""I Do Believe We're Naked"", by Funky C Funky Do, replaces ""We're Sending Our Love Down The Well"", which plunges all the way down to number ninety-seven."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Ever since I've called for the rescue of that Simpson lad, I 'Have taken a lot of heat. So, I am flip-flopping. I say, ""Let him stay down there!"""
Dave Shutton,"Yeah, Shutton here. Now that's a story!"
Marge Simpson,"Bart? Honey, I made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you're down in the well."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, it's too big."
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, you'll grow into it."
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Bart Simpson,"You know, I've done a lot of bad stuff through the years. I guess now I'm paying the price. But there's so many things I'll never get a chance to do. Smoke a cigarette, use a fake I.D., shave a swear word in my hair..."
Homer Simpson,"That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more. I'm gonna get you outta there myself."

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,The canary!
Marge Simpson,"Sting, you look tired. Maybe you should take a rest."
Sting,Not while one of my fans needs me.
Marge Simpson,"Actually, I don't know if I've ever heard Bart play one of your albums--"
Homer Simpson,"Shh! Marge, he's a good digger."
Bart Simpson,Sting!
Bart Simpson,Mom! Dad!
Marge Simpson,"Oh Bart, I've missed you so much."
Bart Simpson,"Man, I was so scared."
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry son, they're gonna make sure no one ever falls down this well again."

Groundskeeper Willie,That should do it.
Bret,"Hey everybody, Bret Gunsilman here in pivotal week three of the NFL on Fox."

Bret,Now stay tuned for six hours of exciting football action.
Homer Simpson,"Well, bye-bye belt."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, all those fatty, deep-fried, heavily salted snacks can't be good for your heart."
Homer Simpson,"Pfft, my heart is just fine."
Homer Simpson,A little beer will put out that fire.
Bret,"And now with his picks for today's games, the man who's right fifty-two percent of the time, Smooth Jimmy Apollo."
JIMMY,"Thank you, Bret. Our first game today -- Denver and New England -- is too close to call."
Homer Simpson,
JIMMY,"But if you're one of those compulsive types who just has to bet -- well, I don't know... uh... Denver."
Homer Simpson,"Whoo hoo! Denver, yeah!"
,
Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern. Where the peanut bowl is freshened hourly.
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I'd like to bet twenty dollars on Denver."

Chief Wiggum,"Oh, sure thing, Moe. I was just using it as a coaster."

Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Look, Dad. I made a modest studio apartment for my Malibu Stacey doll. This is the kitchen, this is where she prints her weekly feminist newsletter..."
Lisa Simpson,DAAAAAD! You're not listening to me.
Homer Simpson,"Lousy, stupid Denver."
,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, look at that, a shoe box house. Lisa, you're so clever."
Lisa Simpson,Why isn't Dad ever interested in anything I do?
Marge Simpson,Well... do you ever take an interest in anything he does?
Lisa Simpson,"No.... well, we used to have burping contests, but I outgrew it."
Marge Simpson,"Hmmm, well, if you want to get closer to him then maybe you should bridge the gap. I do it all the time. I pretend I'm interested in looking at power tools, going to those silly car chase movies, and... some things I'll tell you about when you're older. Do you understand?"
Lisa Simpson,I think so.
Marge Simpson,Bart!
Bart Simpson,Whaaat?
Announcer,"Ho, look at that score. Moxy!"
Homer Simpson,Why did you do that?
Lisa Simpson,Wouldn't it be fun if we watched the game together?
Homer Simpson,"Okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there."
Homer Simpson,Over.
Homer Simpson,Over... over... over...
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, please, I can't hear the announcer."
Lisa Simpson,He said Denver just fumbled.
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"See you in Hell, soldier boy!"
Marge Simpson,Bart?
Bart Simpson,Yeah mom?
Marge Simpson,"I was thinking that while your father and Lisa watch the game, it might be fun if the two of us went clothes shopping."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I'd love to. But to be honest, I don't need new clothes."
Marge Simpson,Oh really?
Marge Simpson,Hmm...
Bart Simpson,So even though I'd love to spend this sunny afternoon trying on clothes. It's not...
JIMMY,"Well folks, when you're right fifty-two percent of the time, you're wrong forty-eight percent of the time."
Homer Simpson,Why didn't you say that before!
Bret,"Okay, Jimmy, you're off the hook. We've got Miami Cincinnati coming up. Any thoughts?"
JIMMY,"I certainly do, Brett. I hereby declare Miami to be Smooth Jimmy's ""Lock of the Week."""
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, that's a big lock all right. I just don't trust that guy."
Sportscaster,"In the Cincinnati - Miami game, I declare Cincinnati to be my ""Shoe-in of the Week""."
Homer Simpson,"Huh, they both make a good case."
Professor Jonathan Frink,"After evaluating millions of pieces of data in the blink of an eye, the Gambletron 2000 says the winner is... Cincinnati by two hundred points?! Why you worthless hunk of junk!"
Coach,You want some of this don't ya?
Homer Simpson,Yeah!
Coach,Well you need to know the winners. And I know the winners. So call me now!
Coach,Whoa! Five dollars for the first minute. Two dollars for each additional minute.
Coach,You have reached the Coach's hot...
Homer Simpson,Line...
Coach,line.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, lay it on me, coach."
Coach,In the game of Mi-a-mi...
Homer Simpson,Mm-hm.
Coach,...versus Cin-
Homer Simpson,Cincinnati...
Coach,cin-
Homer Simpson,Cincinnati.
Coach,nat-
Homer Simpson,Cincinnati.
Coach,ti...
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, c'mon! Don't you realize this is costing me money?"
Coach,We must consider many things. The wind...
Homer Simpson,"Doh, not the wind."
Coach,...is blowing out of the west...
Homer Simpson,Oh...
Coach,at five
Homer Simpson,... miles per hour.
Coach,knots...
Homer Simpson,"Ugh, this is ridiculous. What am I supposed to do? Lisa, who do you think's gonna win? The Bengals or the Dolphins?"
Homer Simpson,"Good, good. Moe, fifty dollars on the Miami Dolphins."
Moe Szyslak,"Gotcha, fifty beans on Miami. Um, Homer, I got a call on the other line. Hello?"
,
Krusty the Clown,"Moe, it's me Mr. ""K."""
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, yeah, what'll it be?"
Krusty the Clown,Put me down for seven hundred dollars on the Rams.
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, and put Sideshow Mel down for two grand."
,
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I'm tired. I wanna go home. Can't I just lie down for a minute?"
Marge Simpson,"Now Bart, I think you'd look very sharp in this shirt."
Bart Simpson,"Fine, get it. Lets go."
Marge Simpson,"No, no, no, you have to try it on."
Marge Simpson,"Oooh, and this one's fifty percent off."
Bart Simpson,"You know why these clothes are on sale, Mom? Because the people who wear them get beaten up."
Marge Simpson,"Well, anyone who beats you up for wearing a shirt isn't your friend. Ooh this looks good.... oh and this one is very, very cute... And these... Oh look! Little bow ties."
Marge Simpson,And don't make that face at me.
Bart Simpson,How'd ya know?
,
Football Announcer #2,Touchdown Dolphins!
Homer Simpson,"All right, Dolphins!"
Lisa Simpson,"All right, Dolphins!"
Homer Simpson,Whoo-hoo!
Lisa Simpson,Whoo-hoo!
Homer Simpson,Fifty big ones!
Lisa Simpson,Fifty big ones?
Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh. You see, Lisa, Daddy's friend Moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the Dolphins won the game."
Lisa Simpson,You mean you made a bet?
Homer Simpson,"Well, I wouldn't call it a bet. It's a little thing Daddies do to make football more exciting."
Lisa Simpson,What could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?
Homer Simpson,"Well... you know... you like ice cream, don't you?"
Lisa Simpson,Uh-huh.
Marge Simpson,See how good things can happen if you make a little effort?
Homer Simpson,And don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. Crumbled up cookie things...
Lisa Simpson,So gambling makes a good thing even better.
Homer Simpson,"That's right. My God, it's like there's some kind of bond between us."

,
Guard #1,We've got a trouble maker in booth eight.
Guard #2,Forget him. There's a code red in booth three.
Guard #1,My God. Those aren't the socks she came in with.
Guard #2,Un-unn. Let's move.
,
Marge Simpson,Bart?
Bart Simpson,"In here, Mom. But don't open the--"
Marge Simpson,"Oh Bart, you could use some new underwear too."
,
Lisa Simpson,"...three, two, one..."
Football Announcer #2,"And the final from Riverfront Stadium, Miami 24 -- Cincinnati 10."
Homer Simpson,YEAH!
Lisa Simpson,"Boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars."
Homer Simpson,"You'd think that wouldn't you. But you see Lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. Even though they say it's okay in the Bible."
Lisa Simpson,"Really, where?"
Homer Simpson,"Uh... somewhere in the back. The point is we had a great time today. And to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. Okay?"
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, dad."
Marge Simpson,Did you two have fun?
Homer Simpson,You bet.
Marge Simpson,"Well, we had fun too. Right now, Bart is modeling his new clothes for his friends."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"You gotta come out sometime, Simpson."
Lisa Simpson,"Goodnight, Dad. I had a really nice time today."
Homer Simpson,"Me too, honey."
Lisa Simpson,Can I watch football with you again next Sunday?
Homer Simpson,Sure! You'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Point well taken. Uh, mom, could you loosen my blanket a little? Dad tucked me in too tight and it's cutting off the circulation in my arms and legs."
Player,This team is fired up! We came here to play!
Homer Simpson,All right!
Lisa Simpson,He'll lose.
Homer Simpson,What? Didn't you hear what he said?
Lisa Simpson,"Look at the fear in his eyes. Listen to the quiver in his voice. He's a little boy, lost in a game of men."
Homer Simpson,You think we should bet against them?
Lisa Simpson,I'd bet my entire college fund on it.
Homer Simpson,You got it.
Homer Simpson,"Moe, twenty-three dollars on New York."
Football Announcer,"Start spreadin' the news, it's New York over Philadelphia, thirty-five to ten."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I hate to break the mood, but I'm getting nauseous."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sorry. So who do you like in the afternoon games?"
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I like the 49ers because they're pure of heart -- Seattle because they got something to prove -- and the Raiders because they always cheat."
Football Announcer,"And in an extremely suspicious play, the Raiders win."
Lisa Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, the new sign is really working."
Librarian,"It's been a madhouse, Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,Let's see... football... Football: homo-eroticism in... oddball Canadian rules... Phyllis George and...
,
Football Announcer,"Oh Doctor, what a finish! The final score -- Atlanta seventeen -- Houston thirteen. And the lowly Falcons are flyin' high. Who would have thunk it?"
Homer Simpson,"My daughter, that's who!"
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, me!"
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you've picked the winner every time! You must have some kind of special gift."
Lisa Simpson,"C'mon, dad. It doesn't take a genius to realize that Houston's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my little girl says the cutest things."
Lisa Simpson,"You know, dad, Sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week."
Homer Simpson,Not Sunday -- Daddy-Daughter day.
,
Homer Simpson,"The usual, Moe. A beer and a wad of bills."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, ya lucky moron."
Moe Szyslak,"Here you go, Homer. A hundred and thirty-five dollars."
Homer Simpson,I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it's the smell of victory.
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, shut up."
,
Marge Simpson,Look at these prices. We could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal.
Homer Simpson,Tut-tut. Only the best for my family.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I can't help wondering where you're getting the money from?"
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, can't a man do something nice for his loved ones?"
Marge Simpson,"Hmm, I guess so."
Marco,"Hello, I'm Marco. I'll be your waiter."
Homer Simpson,"Hello, I'm Homer. I'll be your customer."
Marco,"Never heard that one before. Uh, would you care to select the wine?"
Bart Simpson,I'll do the honors.
Bart Simpson,"No. No. No. No. My God, what passes for a wine list these days. Marco, just bring us your freshest bottle of wine. Chop. Chop."
Marco,Charming lad.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, violin guy!"
Homer Simpson,"What's your favorite song, Lisa?"
Lisa Simpson,The Broken Neck Blues.
Homer Simpson,Play on.
,
Bret,"It is the play-offs, it's five below and there's one loyal fan wearing nothing but a g-string and the team colors painted on his body."
JIMMY,He doesn't look too happy.
Bret,"Well, maybe the paint has shut off his pores and he's slowly suffocating. Still, that is a real fan."
Homer Simpson,"Well, Lisa, it's Daddy-Daughter day and Daddy needs daughter's picks."
Homer Simpson,You promised you wouldn't get mad!
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I'm making the Chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. And with your blessing, I'd like to tie it to the Cowboys plus five at Chicago."
Homer Simpson,"Good, good... You call Moe."
Lisa Simpson,"Moe, this is L.S. calling for H.S."
Moe Szyslak,"Just give me the bet, Lisa."
,
Moe Szyslak,"Hundred and ten, a hundred and twenty... You lucky son-of-a..."
Barney Gumble,"Hey Homer, you wanna go bowling next Sunday?"
Homer Simpson,"Barney, are you nuts? That's the Super Bowl. How about the Sunday after that?"
Barney Gumble,"Well, my ma's coming in from Norway, but... uh what the hell."
,
Ralph Wiggum,And when the doctor said I didn't have worms anymore -- that was the happiest day of my life.
Miss Hoover,"Thank you, Ralph. Very graphic. Lisa Simpson? Would you like to read your essay?"
Lisa Simpson,"The happiest day of my life was three Sundays ago. I was sitting on my daddy's knee when the Saints, who were four and a half point favorites, but only up by three, kicked a meaningless field goal at the last second, to cover the spread."
Miss Hoover,Dear God!
,
Lisa Simpson,"Oh dad, you must've bought me every Malibu Stacey accessory there is."
Homer Simpson,Not quite. They were out of the Malibu Stacie Lunar Rovers.
Marge Simpson,"Ooh, perfume. Meryl Streep's ""Versatility."""
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I know you're gonna like your present."
Box,Shut up. Shut up. Kiss my butt. Shut up. Go to Hell. Go to Hell.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I promise you I will never get tired of this."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, those are very thoughtful presents. But you have to tell me where you got the money from."
Homer Simpson,"All right, Marge. I'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad."
Marge Simpson,"I promise I will get mad, because I always do when you make me promise I won't."
Homer Simpson,"All right. If you must know, Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football."
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Marge Simpson,I did not! I promised I would get mad! She's an eight-year-old girl.
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, she never loses. She's got a gift. Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?"
Marge Simpson,But gambling is illegal.
Homer Simpson,"Only in forty-eight states. Besides, it's a victimless crime. The only victim is Moe, heh, heh, heh. And it's brought Lisa and me together."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I just don't know."
Homer Simpson,"Look, what's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep, and I've got that foot massager I've always wanted."
Homer Simpson,"Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this."
Lisa Simpson,"You know, dad, we've been watching a lot of TV lately. Maybe, the Sunday after the Super Bowl, we could hike up to the top of Mount Springfield. The fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets."
Homer Simpson,"Well, that sounds great honey, but next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney."
Lisa Simpson,What about Daddy-Daughter day?
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away."
Lisa Simpson,So that's it. You just wanted me to help you gamble. You never wanted to be with me at all.
Marge Simpson,You're a very selfish man.
Box,Go to hell! Go to hell!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, once again. Great present, Dad."
Lisa Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,My third husband bought me this.
Lisa Simpson,Give me some chips for it.
Dealer,"Are you sure, ma'am?"
Lisa Simpson,"Don't tell me what to do, Sonny. I've been gambling since I was eight. And I've been hockin' jewelry since I was twelve. Now give me some chips!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Look around you, Malibu Stacey. All this was bought with dirty money. Your penthouse, your Alfa Romeo, your collagen injection clinic."
Lisa Simpson,"You're going back into the shoe-box. It may not be pretty, but dammit, it's honest."
Lisa Simpson,"I, Lisa Simpson, am hereby giving away all my ill-gotten Malibu Stacey accessories!"
Homer Simpson,"Look Lisa, I bought you a Malibu Stacey Chinchilla coat."
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Lisa Simpson,"So you've come to buy my forgiveness. Sorry, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Look Lisa, honey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But I really had a good time watching football with you. And I think you had a good time with me."
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, I did."
Homer Simpson,"Well, c'mon, we can still watch the Super Bowl together. Can't we? Eh? Huh?"
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I would like to see what all the fuss is about."
Homer Simpson,It's a date! So... do you think the Cowboys will beat the spread?
Lisa Simpson,Put me down.
Lisa Simpson,"Look dad, I'll tell you who's gonna win the Super Bowl if you want me to. But it'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me."
Homer Simpson,Okay.
Lisa Simpson,I think Dallas is a mortal lock.
Homer Simpson,Dallas! Whoo-hoo!
Lisa Simpson,However...
Homer Simpson,"However? What however? What do you mean, however? However what?"
Lisa Simpson,"However, I may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously I want you to lose. In which case, I'd bet the farm on Buffalo."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, do me a favor. Complete this sentence: ""Daddy should bet all his money on..."""
Lisa Simpson,I don't know.
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"If I still love you, Dallas. If I don't, Buffalo."
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I think that chip's got enough dip on it."
Bret,We're live from Miami Florida home of Super Bowl Twenty-nine. Today we're gonna be seen by people in over one hundred fifty countries all over the world. Including our latest stolen affiliates overseas.

UGOLIN,Stupide.
Nutty Comedian,Whaa! I'm sorry Mrs. Wellenmelon.
Cesar,Formidable!

Bart Simpson,"Oh, this sucks. C'mon snipers. Where are you?"

Moe Szyslak,"Moe's Tavern, Home of the Super Sunday Brunch Spectacular."
Barney Gumble,Oh! Baloney. Bread!
Moe Szyslak,Gotcha ya down for forty bucks. Good luck Your Eminence.
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Homer, you can't take any more of my money. I'm, uh, outta the bookie business."
Barney Gumble,"But Moe, you've been taking bets all..."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey Barney, how 'bout a free beer?"
Barney Gumble,Wow!
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Moe. I'm not bettin'."
Moe Szyslak,What? Gimme that.
Barney Gumble,
Homer Simpson,"I had the greatest gift of all, a little girl who could pick football and I ruined it."
Bret,"Well sir, we're two hours and forty-five minutes into the pre-game show and we've got ourselves a special guest. Actor Troy McClure, whose new sitcom is premiering tonight -- coincidentally enough, right after the game!"
Troy McClure,"Thanks, Bret. My new show's called ""Handle with Care"". I play Jack Handle, a retired cop who shares an apartment with a retired criminal. We're the original odd couple!"
Bret,What made you want to do a situation comedy?
Troy McClure,"Well, I fell in love with the script, Bret, and my recent trouble with the IRS sealed the deal."
Bret,"Could be another Drexel's Class. Ooh, looks like we're almost ready for the kickoff."
Football Announcer,"Dallas kicks -- oh, it's a bad kick, way too short. Buffalo's going to start with excellent field position."
Homer Simpson,Buffalo's gonna win. Lisa hates me!
Larry,Whatcha got riding on this game?
Homer Simpson,My daughter.
Larry,What a gambler.
Football Announcer,That was the score at the half. Buffalo fourteen: Dallas seven.
,
Football Announcer,It's time for the never tedious Super Bowl halftime show.
Alien,"People of Earth, we've come ten billion light years to bring you this halftime message of peace."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, who's winning?"
Bart Simpson,You hate dad is up by a touchdown.
,
Barflies,Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Yea!!
Duff Announcer,It's a touchdown for half-back Dan Beer-dorf! Duff Dry has won the Duff Bowl!
Moe Szyslak,They wanted it more.
Barney Gumble,"Hey Homer, didn't you say if Duff Dry wins, your daughter loves you?"
Homer Simpson,Not Duff Dry... Dallas.
Barney Gumble,"Okay, okay. They're both great teams."
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Football Announcer,Touchdown Cowboys!
Homer Simpson,"All right, we're back in business."
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, I'm glad some people could resist the lures of the big game."
Man,"Oh my God, I forgot the game!"
,
Football Announcer,"So, with three ticks left on the clock, it all comes down to this one play. If Dallas scores here, happy fans'll be looting and turning over cars in the Lone Star state tonight. Here's the handoff."
Homer Simpson,"Please, please, please..."
Football Announcer,Touchdown! Stick a fork in this one. It is done. The Dallas Cowboys wins Super Bowl twenty-nine.
,
Bart Simpson,I guess you love dad.
Lisa Simpson,I suspected as much.
,
Homer Simpson,Yes! She loves me! She loves me!
Moe Szyslak,What are you so happy about Homer? You didn't win any money.
Homer Simpson,"Money comes and money goes, but what I have with my daughter can go on for eight more years!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Come on, Dad!"
Homer Simpson,It's beautiful.
Lisa Simpson,Isn't it though?
Homer Simpson,After I catch my breath... can we... go... home?

Carl Carlson,That's it?
Marge Simpson,"Now Maggie, when you grow up you can suck your pacifier all you want."
Maggie Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Extra mustard for Bart, sliced diagonally not lengthwise... Light mayo for Lisa, cut off the crust... Double bologna for Homer...."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I split my pants again. Oooh, can I have two sandwiches today? Make them bologna sandwiches too. Can I have two slices of bologna and cheese..."
Marge Simpson,One at a time! One at a time!
Lisa Simpson,"Don't even bother with the raisins. I'm not gonna eat 'em... Double bologna! Double bologna!... I don't ask for much, just no pimento. Don't forget to make it double bologna 'cause I can hardly..."
Marge Simpson,That's enough!
Marge Simpson,"There you go, Lisa. No pimentos. Bart, your hat's where you left it, behind the toilet. Homer, I'll sew your pants but I'm out of bologna."
Bart Simpson,Thanks mom.
Lisa Simpson,Thanks mom.
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Videos to return, grocery list, flea dip for the cat, Homer's dry-cleaning -- I think that's everything."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, can you take my ball to Nick's today? A bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I'm running late as it is. Can't you just use one of the balls at the alley?"
Homer Simpson,Alley balls?
Marge Simpson,"Alright, don't whine. Just put it in my left hand."
Marge Simpson,Kids! Hurry up or you're going to miss your bus!
Lisa Simpson,No way.
Bart Simpson,Never happen.
Bart Simpson,"Well, I'll be damned."

Marge Simpson,Get out.

Marge Simpson,No. I mean a vacation by myself.
Homer Simpson,"What? You mean we're getting a divorce? Marge, I can change!"

Marge Simpson,Homer! If Maggie really doesn't want to leave the house maybe she should just stay with you.

Troy McClure,"Ahh... Ahh... Gregory, where have you been all my life?"
Troy McClure,Feeling tense?
Marge Simpson,Uh-huh.
Troy McClure,Then just push nine on your phone. Then the pound sign. Then four-eight-three. We'll do the rest.
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Maggie. Nummy, nummy num."
Homer Simpson,Mmm. Strained peas.
Homer Simpson,Let go!
Gregory,"Marge, it's times like this I'm glad I flunked out of that Mexican med school."
,
Marge Simpson,Hi Homie. I feel much better.
Homer Simpson,Hi Barney. Thanks for keeping me company.
Barney Gumble,"No problem. Well, well, if it isn't little Bart. Remember your Uncle Barney? Hey Homer, let me hold him."
Homer Simpson,"All right, but just be careful."
Barney Gumble,"Whoa... someone smells stinky. Oh, it's me."
,
Lisa Simpson,Bart you really shouldn't be looking through other people's things. Find anything good?

Barney Gumble,"Don't worry, don't worry. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna make you an omlette."
Homer Simpson,Just help me look!
Barney Gumble,Are you sure? I make 'em with two kinds of cheese.
Homer Simpson,C'mon!
Barney Gumble,"Hey, Homer. I think I've got her."
Barney Gumble,Come on!
Homer Simpson,Barney! You're gonna pull her arm off.
Barney Gumble,"The sooner I get her out, the sooner we can have omlettes."

FABRIZIO,"So, what's the verdict?"
Woman,"Oh, dear God! I can't even put a bag over my head!"
FABRIZIO,"Yes, you can."

Homer Simpson,Hello... I'd like the department of missing babies.
Voice,Please hold.

Troy McClure,By now you've seen what Rancho Relaxo has to offer.
Marge Simpson,Uh-huh.
Troy McClure,"But remember, we can't tell you how to have a good time. You have to tell us."
Marge Simpson,Oh.
Troy McClure,"As I said to Dolores Montenegro in ""Calling All Quakers"": ""Have it your way, baby."""
Marge Simpson,"Hello, room service? This is Marge Simpson. I'd like a hot fudge sundae. With whipped cream. And some chocolate chip cheesecake. And a bottle of tequila."

Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, I've got good news for you. The dog didn't run away."
Marge Simpson,"Well, good. I'm coming home, honey. You can pick me up at the train station in an hour. And bring the kids. Bye!"
Homer Simpson,
,
Chief Wiggum,"Please, don't jump. I know you're going through some tough times, but you have your whole life ahead of you!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Now, Marge. Maggie was very young. It's not like we got so attached to her. No. Marge, isn't life funny? One day they're babies, the next thing you know, they're off on their own. Oh."
Chief Wiggum,You the man who reported the lost baby?
Homer Simpson,Yes.
CHIF WIGGUM,Can you describe her?
Homer Simpson,Uh... she's small... she's a girl...
Chief Wiggum,Bingo!
Homer Simpson,Oh Maggie!
Chief Wiggum,Not so fast! You're wanted on three counts of criminal neglect.
Homer Simpson,"You found my baby. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
Chief Wiggum,"Ah, shucks. Just don't do it again, you big lug."

Homer Simpson,You're not going anywhere.

Marge Simpson,"Hi, did you miss me?"
Homer Simpson,Never leave again... never leave again... never leave again.
Marge Simpson,I missed you too.

Marge Simpson,And from now on I hope you'll help me out a little more than you're used to.
Homer Simpson,"You got it, sweetheart. You have enough blanket there?"

Seymour Skinner,"Now, boys and girls, let's welcome our special guest, Ted Carpenter from the Twirl King yo-yo company."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I think I speak for everyone in this bed when I say you have nothing to worry about. Now let's just try and get a little shut eye, okay?"
Teenager,"Hey, what gives?"
Dad,"You said you wanted to live in a world without zinc, Jimmy. Well, now your car has no battery."
Teenager,But I promised Betty I'd pick her up by six. I'd better give her a call.
,
Dad,"Sorry Jimmy. Without zinc for the rotary mechanism, there are no telephones."
Teenager,"Dear God, what have I done?"
Dad,"Think again, Jimmy. You see, the firing pin in your gun was made of -- yup, zinc."
Teenager,Come back zinc! Come back...
Teenager,"Come back... zinc. Come back... zinc. Zinc! Zinc! What? Oh, it was all a dream. Thank goodness I still live in a world of telephones... car batteries... hand guns..."
Teenager,And many things made of zinc.
Bart Simpson,"Gross, he's picking his nose!"
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"If anyone wants to learn more about zinc, they're welcome to stay..."

Edna Krabappel-Flanders,One more day at least.
Service Manager,Bingo! Bango! Sugar in the gas tank. Your ex-husband strikes again.

Ted,"Presenting, the Twirl King Champions!"
Ted,Mister Amazing!
Ted,Sparkle!
Lisa Simpson,She's beautiful!
Ted,Zero Gravity!
Ted,The Cobra!
Bart Simpson,Those guys must be millionaires!
Nelson Muntz,I bet they get all kinds of girls!
Miss Hoover,I question the educational value of this assembly.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Hey, it'll be one of their few pleasant memories when they're pumpin' gas for a living."
Sound-alikes,THIS IS THE DAWNING OF THE AGE OF AQUARIUS! AGE OF AQUARIUS! AQUARIUS! AQUARIUS!
Kids,
Mister Amazing,"Now, for our next stunt, what do you say we get your Principal up here!"
Seymour Skinner,No. Mmm... careful now...ooh... gee that one grazed my ear...
Mister Amazing,Don't move. You could really get hurt.
Seymour Skinner,Oh.
Bart Simpson,How much do those yo-yos cost?
Milhouse Van Houten,I don't care!
Kids,Good-bye! Bye! Bye!
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, thanks Sparkle. Wait, this isn't you."
Sparkle,That's the old Sparkle.
Ted,All right! Get your worthless butts in the van! We've got three more schools to do. Come on lets go go go.
Chuck,That's your trick?
Nelson Muntz,No. Here's my trick!
Bart Simpson,Thank you. Thank you.
,
Homer Simpson,Marge. Come here.
Homer Simpson,Can you believe it? Pretty soon I'll be able to quit my job and live off the boy.
Marge Simpson,What? Name me one person who's gotten rich by doing yo-yo tricks.
Homer Simpson,
,
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"After two months at sea, the Pilgrims were running out of food and water... Yes Nelson?"
Nelson Muntz,Did they have any yo-yos?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"No, they did not have yo-yos. When they landed at Plymouth rock they were greeted by the friendly Wampanoag Indians...."
Milhouse Van Houten,Did the Indians have yo-yos?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"No, they did not have yo-yos. That's it. I am sick and tired of talking about yo-yos. From now on I will not accept any book reports, science projects, dioramas, or anything else on yo-yos or yo-yo related topics. Am I making myself clear?"
Bart Simpson,Yo.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey Bart, got any new tricks for us today?"
Bart Simpson,Just one. A little something I call Plucking the Pickle.
Bart Simpson,"I build up a little steam, and..."
Bart Simpson,I didn't do it.
,
Groundskeeper Willie,"Don't worry about your wee fish, Lass. They're going to a better place."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Bart, that's one month's detention."
Bart Simpson,"Mrs. Krabappel, we're all upset by the untimely deaths of Stinky and Wrinkles. But life goes on. So, if I could just have my yo-yo back..."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Bart, if I were you, and you were me, would you give back the yo-yo?"
Bart Simpson,Here you go... Just kidding. Here you go... Just kidding.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Well, would you?"
Bart Simpson,Absolutely.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,
,
Jasper Beardly,"What's eatin' you, woman? Your personal ad said you wanted a man. Well, you got yourself a humdinger."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,I don't know. I guess I expected something different from your photo.
Jasper Beardly,Don't let my age fool you. Just cause there's a little snow on the roof... I forget how the rest of that goes.
,
Lisa Simpson,Is it that girl with the lazy eye patch?
Bart Simpson,"One months detention... She'll pay for this. Yup, there's your problem... someone jammed a Malibu Stacy head down here."
Miss Hoover,"Edna, happy hour in the Teacher's Lounge."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Just a sec.
Bart Simpson,"Huh. One plus one equals two? Recently divorced fourth-grade teacher wishes to meet man age 18-60. Object: save me. Write Edna K, Box 402."
Bart Simpson,Hmmm.
Bart Simpson,"Dear Edna, I've never answered a personal ad before, but I found yours irresistible. My name is..."
,
Romantic Lover Voice,"...Woodrow. I like holding hands and dinner by candle light. And oh, yes, I really hate yo-yos."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Oh, Woodrow."
,
Marge Simpson,Maybe we should let the dog in?
Homer Simpson,"Marge, dogs love the outdoors."
Marge Simpson,I think he needs a dog house.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?"
Marge Simpson,I'll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers."
Marge Simpson,I am not!
Homer Simpson,"Yes you are. You've been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on TV. I know, I'll build him a dog house."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I don't know..."
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. I just drew up a little blueprint. Now let me walk you through it.
Homer Simpson,"This is the door. He goes through that. This is the roof. And this happy character here is the sun. He shines down on the house, see."
Marge Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"How was detention today, dear?"
Bart Simpson,"Oh, not bad. I'm starting to get the hang of the floor waxer."
Bart Simpson,Yes!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"""Dear Woodrow, I must admit I'm intrigued. You're not like the other men I've met."""
Bart Simpson,Yeah. I'm the 28th President of the United States.
Lisa Simpson,Mmm! Could it be there's a special someone you're not telling me about?
Bart Simpson,"Oh, please."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"""But I've had some bad experiences with these ads. So, I'd like to learn more about you. Please write back soon. Here's a photo that'll get your pencil moving."""
Bart Simpson,You've got a date with a xerox machine.

Ned Flanders,"Fella came into the store today and asked for change for a dollar. Well sir, I gave him three quarters by mistake. Took me the whole afternoon to track him down."
Maude Flanders,"Todd, would you like some mixed vegetables?"
Todd Flanders,Hell no!
Maude Flanders,What did you say?
Todd Flanders,I said I don't want any damn vegetables.
Ned Flanders,"All right, that's it, young man. No Bible stories for you tonight."
Maude Flanders,Weren't you a little hard on him?
Ned Flanders,"Well, you knew I had a temper when you married me."
,
Helen Lovejoy,Ned Flanders is on the phone.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"If this is about that stupid quarter again -- Hello, Ned."
Ned Flanders,"Sorry to bother you, Reverend Lovejoy, but I'm kind of in a tizzy. Our son Todd just told us he didn't want to eat his ""damn vegetables."""
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, you know kids and vegetables. What was it, asparagus?"
Ned Flanders,"No Reverend, the point is, he said a bad word."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, oh right, yeah. Kids usually pick these things up from someplace. Find out who's doing it and... uh, direct them to the Bible."
Ned Flanders,Where in the Bible?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Uh... page nine-hundred.
Ned Flanders,But Reverend...
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Damn Flanders.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lis, a moment of your time."
Lisa Simpson,Yeah?
Bart Simpson,Suppose I was writing a second letter to a girl and I already used up my A material. What should I say?
Lisa Simpson,Is it Terri?
Lisa Simpson,Is it that exchange student Mx!pa?
Bart Simpson,No! It's not for me. It's homework.
Lisa Simpson,"Sure it is. Hey Bart, let's do some homework."
,
Southern Private,"Golly, Sergeant Carter, I can't fix your jeep. But maybe this will make it up to you. Galveston, oh Galveston..."
Ned Flanders,Is this all he watches?
Maude Flanders,"Oh, he used to watch ""Davy and Goliath,"" but he thought the idea of a talking dog was blasphemous."
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey Mom, did you save the love letters Dad sent you?"
Marge Simpson,Of course I saved them.
Marge Simpson,"Although actually there's only one. And it's more of a love postcard, from some brewery he visited."
Homer Simpson,"""Maybe it's the beer talking, Marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. They got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? Get outta here."""
Bart Simpson,"Wow, a side of dad I've never seen."
,
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,
Bart Simpson,"Penny for your thoughts, Mrs. K."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"I was just thinking... oh, you wouldn't be interested."
Bart Simpson,Try me. Sometimes it helps to talk.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Well, I was just wishing I could meet a man who... likes the way I look first thing in the morning... laughs at my jokes..."
Bart Simpson,Uh-huh.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,...can fix my car...
Bart Simpson,Oh yeah.

Bart Simpson,Dear Edna: Your photo took my breath away.

Ned Flanders,"He's not getting it from his brother, that's for darn sure."
Homer Simpson,"Damn, crappy nails! Super glue my butt!"
Ned Flanders,
,
Homer Simpson,
Ned Flanders,Homer?
Homer Simpson,"What is it, Flanders?"
Ned Flanders,I'm afraid I have a bone to pick with you.
Homer Simpson,"Look, if this is about your camcorder -- I lost it, okay?"
Ned Flanders,"No, I-I came to talk to you about your potty-mouth."
Homer Simpson,What the hell are you talking about?
Ned Flanders,"Look Homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. So, I don't want to be hard on you... but I just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys."
Homer Simpson,"Oh come on now, Flanders, I don't complain about your your... moustache."
Ned Flanders,What's wrong with my moustache?
Homer Simpson,Makes you look like you've got something to hide.
Ned Flanders,What?
Homer Simpson,People are talking... lots of people.
Ned Flanders,"Okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. I'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay?"
Homer Simpson,Aye-aye! Admiral Butthead.
Announcer,"We now return to ""Two for Tunsia"" on Colorization Theater."
Charles Boyer,"Ah, my love... A million poets could try for a million years and still describe but three-eighths of your beauty."

Bart Simpson,"Strap on your skates Gordie, you're going in."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, do you want to hear something funny? Flanders thinks I swear too much. Marge, you're not laughing."
Marge Simpson,"Well, you know, maybe he's right."
Homer Simpson,"Well what a surprise. Marge sticks up for Flanders! Can we have one conversation where you don't bring up your hero, Ned Flanders?"
Marge Simpson,"Actually, Homer, you brought up Ned Flanders. I never said a word --"
Homer Simpson,"Look, we're past that. Marge, maybe I do curse a little, but that's the way God made me. And I'm too old to stop now."
Marge Simpson,"No, you're not. When my father got out of the Navy, he used to curse a blue streak. It almost cost him his job as a baby photographer. So, my mom put a Swear Jar in the kitchen. Every time he said a bad word, he put in a quarter. What do you think?"
Homer Simpson,"Well Marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. Bring on the swear jar."
Homer Simpson,Do I have to pay if I hit my hand with the hammer?
Marge Simpson,"Yes, Homer."
Homer Simpson,What if I catch on fire?
Marge Simpson,"No, Homer."
Homer Simpson,What if I see something really weird in the sky?
Marge Simpson,"Yes, Homer."
Homer Simpson,What about when we snuggle?
Marge Simpson,Uh... that's okay.

Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"""Dear Woodrow, it's time for us to meet. Why don't we go out to dinner and afterward we can go to my apartment for some home cookin'."""
Bart Simpson,Huh? Aye carumba!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"...Hungrily yours, Edna."""
Bart Simpson,"Well, she's dangled on the line long enough. It's time to boat this bass."

Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"When I read your letters, I feel as if you are right here watching me..."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Bart! Eyes down.
Bart Simpson,"Yes, ma'am."
Bart Simpson,"""Edna, every second until we meet stabs me like a thousand needles..."""
Romantic Lover Voice,"""Join me at the Gilded Truffle this Saturday at eight. Perhaps later we will smooch up a storm. Sexily yours, Woody."""
,
,
,
Bart Simpson,I can't help but feel partly responsible.
Bart Simpson,"Homer, that was a twenty."
Homer Simpson,God --
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, you son-of-a."
Ned Flanders,"Hey Homer, Ya know, I owe you one, buddy. No sooner had I shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, I tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal."
Homer Simpson,You dirty bas...
Homer Simpson,"What do ya think, Lisa?"
Lisa Simpson,How's the dog supposed to get in?
Homer Simpson,"Well, he just goes... Ohhh"
,
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Oh, Woodrow. How could you stand me up?"
Bart Simpson,"Mrs. K, whoever this guy is, you don't need him. There are plenty of good men around."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Name one.
Bart Simpson,What's wrong with Principal Skinner?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Seymour? Huh, let's just say his mommy won't let him out to play."
Bart Simpson,What about Coach Fortner?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Glug, glug, glug, glug..."
Bart Simpson,Wow! What about Groundskeeper Willie?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"I'm not even gonna tell you what that guy's into. Bart, you're the closest thing to a man in my life. And that's so depressing, I think I'm gonna cry."
Bart Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh fudge, that's broken."
Homer Simpson,"Fiddle dee dee. That will require a tetanus shot. I'm not going to swear, but I am going to kick this doghouse down."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, this is not a commentary on your skills, but we bought you a new doghouse."
Homer Simpson,Where'd you get the money?
Marge Simpson,"There was more than enough in the swear jar. And if you look inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise."
Homer Simpson,Maggie. Oh. Cute.
Marge Simpson,"No, behind her."
Homer Simpson,Beer! How did you know?
Marge Simpson,Where's Maggie? Where's Maggie?
Marge Simpson,There's Maggie!
Bart Simpson,"Mom, this is a little ahead of schedule, but I need help with my love life."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, my special little guy has a sweetheart."
Lisa Simpson,"I knew it. All right, Bart, who's your girlfriend?"
Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel.
Homer Simpson,"Bart, this is your teacher? I should start going to parents night."
Marge Simpson,"Homer! Bart, you did a very cruel thing."
Homer Simpson,"Boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth."
Marge Simpson,"No, Homer. The truth would humiliate her."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. I only said it because I thought that's what you wanted to hear."
Lisa Simpson,Maybe we should write her another letter. One that says good-bye but lets her feel loved.
Homer Simpson,Step aside everyone. Sensitive love letters are my specialty.
Homer Simpson,"""Dear Baby, welcome to Dumpville. Population: you."""
Marge Simpson,We'll all help.
Lisa Simpson,"""Though I'll be inoculating babies in Kampuchea, my heart will always be with you."""
Bart Simpson,"That sucks. How 'bout, ""Crocodiles bit off my face."""
Marge Simpson,"That's disgusting. And besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face."
Homer Simpson,"I may hold you to that, Marge."
Lisa Simpson,"""Okay, okay... I cannot see you for the next five years, for I will be farming the ocean floor."""
Bart Simpson,"""I must finish this letter quickly, for I have only four minutes to live."""
Homer Simpson,Three simple words. I am gay.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, for the last time, I am not putting that in."
Lisa Simpson,"""And any time I hear the wind blow, it will whisper the name... Edna!"""
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that's very good, Lisa."
Homer Simpson,P.S. -- I am gay.
Marge Simpson,How shall we end it?
Homer Simpson,"How about, ""With a love that will echo through the ages?"""
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that's sweet."
Bart Simpson,"Ohhh, Homer, you old honey dripper."
Homer Simpson,Why you little...
,
,
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Wait! Wait!
,
Romantic Lover Voice,"""Dearest Edna, I must leave you. Why I cannot say. Where? You cannot know. How I will get there, I haven't decided yet. But one thing I can tell you, any time I hear the wind blow, it will whisper the name... Edna."""

Charlie,That's for hiccups.
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, look at this."
Lenny Leonard,Softball starts this week.
Homer Simpson,Softball?
Homer Simpson,Who's next?

Lenny Leonard,"Homer, last year we were two and twenty-eight."
Homer Simpson,"Look, I know it wasn't our best season."
Lenny Leonard,"Actually, it was."
Homer Simpson,"Well, this year's gonna be different."
Carl Carlson,Oh yeah. What makes you so damn sure?
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,I have a secret weapon.
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, he's been holding' out on us."
Charlie,A secret weapon? I wonder what it could be.
,
Homer Simpson,"Come here boy, I want to show you something."
Bart Simpson,What's that? A home-made bat?
Homer Simpson,"It's something very special. A home-made bat. It all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked myself out of the house..."
Homer Simpson,"Sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find."
Homer Simpson,"Something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that I could make a bat out of."
Homer Simpson,I put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat.
Marge Simpson,"Homie, come to bed."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, go back to the garage."
Homer Simpson,And here it is.
Bart Simpson,Wow! How many home runs you gonna hit with that?
Homer Simpson,Let's see... we play thirty games... ten at bats a game... three thousand.
Bart Simpson,
,
Lenny Leonard,"Hit one here, Charlie."
Umpire,"Okay, let's go over the ground rules. You can't leave first until you chug a beer. Any man scoring has to chug a beer. You have to chug a beer at the top of all odd numbered innings. Oh, and the fourth inning is the beer inning."
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, we know how to play softball."
Umpire,Play ball!
Dispatcher,Attention all units! Attention all units! Armored car being robbed at...
Chief Wiggum,Turn off that damn radio!
Marge Simpson,And the next man wants to hit the ball too. And he does. And there he goes off in that direction. And everyone is happy.
Bart Simpson,"Uh, Mom, why don't you let me call the game."
Marge Simpson,That's all right dear. I can do it.
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, stop that!"
Carl Carlson,"Okay, Homer, bases loaded and you're up. Where's that secret weapon?"
Homer Simpson,"Check it out, boys. My magic bat."
Lenny Leonard,"Yeah, I got a magic bat, too."
Carl Carlson,And I got an enchanted jock strap.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, just watch."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoooooo!
Homer Simpson,Ha ha. Cops can't win!
Chief Wiggum,Get his license and registration.
Eddie,"Right, Chief."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, Dad."
Bart Simpson,"Homer, can I get you a beer?"
Lisa Simpson,"No, I want to get him a beer."
Homer Simpson,"Kids, kids, kids. You can each get me a beer. But first let's see it again in super slow motion."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Such a mighty wallop.
Carl Carlson,"Hey, I got my magic bat off a piano."
Charlie,My sister let me use her wooden leg.

Waylon Smithers,"Good news, sir! The plant's softball team has won again. If we beat Shelbyville next week we capture the pennant."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Did you hear that, Ari? My boys need only to thump your tub and the title is ours."
ARI,Ha!! My gladiators from my power plant will crush your team like nine flabby grapes.
C. Montgomery Burns,I disagree.
ARI,Would you care to bet a million dollars on that?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, if we're going to bet, why don't we make it interesting?"
ARI,What? A million dollars isn't interesting to you?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, did you say a million? I'm... I'm sorry, my mind was elsewhere. I thought you would start with a small amount, then we would bait each other and... well, you know how it goes. Yes... certainly, a million will be fine."
C. Montgomery Burns,Um-hm.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I've been thinking. Is it wrong to cheat in order to win a million dollar bet?"
Waylon Smithers,"Yes, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Let me rephrase that. Is it wrong if I cheat in order to win a million dollar bet?
Waylon Smithers,"No, sir! Whom should I kill?"
Homer Simpson,"I did! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! In your face, Strawberry!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, Smithers. I've decided to bring in a few ringers. Professional baseballers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"We'll give them token jobs at the plant and have them play on our softball team. Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, Mordecai ""Three Finger"" Brown..."
Waylon Smithers,Uh... sir...
C. Montgomery Burns,"What is it, Smithers?"
Waylon Smithers,"I'm afraid... all those players have retired and... uh... passed on. In fact, your right fielder has been dead for a hundred and thirty years."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Damnation! All right, find me some good players. Living players! Scour the professional ranks. The American League. The National League. The Negro Leagues."
Waylon Smithers,"I'm on my way, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, and Smithers... You have twenty-four hours."
,
Jose Canseco,"I get $50,000 to play one game?"
Waylon Smithers,"That's right, Mr. Canseco."
Jose Canseco,"Well, it's a pay cut. But what the hey, it sounds like fun."
,
Waylon Smithers,Ow.
Mike Scioscia,"Hey, sorry! I thought you were a deer."
Waylon Smithers,"That's okay, happens all the time. Are you Mike Scioscia?"
Mike Scioscia,That's me.
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, how do you like working for the Dodgers?"
Mike Scioscia,"Well, it's okay. But sometimes I wish I had something a little more blue collar. You know, with big machines and cool dials and stuff, like an oil refinery or a hydro-electric plant."
Waylon Smithers,We should talk.
,
Tour Guide,"And this is Elvis' rec room. When the King wasn't rehearsing or exercising, he liked to unwind by watching up to three TVs at once."
Ozzie Smith,"Man, oh, man, what a lifestyle."
Waylon Smithers,"Excuse me, are you Ozzie Smith?"
Ozzie Smith,Yes.
Waylon Smithers,I have a proposition for you...
,
Waylon Smithers,"Hello, are you Don Mattingly?"
Don Mattingly,"Yes, yes I am. Come in. Come in. Can I get you something? What's your name?"
,
Waylon Smithers,How would you like to be a ringer on a small town company softball team?
Steve Sax,Would I!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,And now I'd like to introduce the new members of our happy power plant family. Our new security guard... Roger Clemens...
Roger Clemens,Hello.
C. Montgomery Burns,"our new janitor, Wade Boggs..."
Wade Boggs,How you doin'?
C. Montgomery Burns,"our new lunchroom cashier... Ken Griffey, Jr...."
KEN GRIFFEY JR.,"Hey, what's up guys?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Our new, well uh, we'll make up jobs for these fellows later... Please say hello to Steve Sax, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry, Ozzie Smith, Mike Scioscia, and Jose Canseco."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, by the way, you new fellows, there's a sign up sheet for the company softball team on the bulletin board over there. Eh, just in case you wish to play."
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Burns. With them on the team, you won't need us!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well... duh. You, Scioscia, sign up..."
Mike Scioscia,"Thanks just the same, but I'm here to run the solid contaminant encapsulator."
C. Montgomery Burns,One more outburst like that and I'll send you back to the big leagues!
Homer Simpson,You're Darryl Strawberry.
Darryl Strawberry,Yes.
Homer Simpson,You play right field.
Darryl Strawberry,Yes.
Homer Simpson,I play right field too.
Darryl Strawberry,So?
Homer Simpson,"Well, are you better than me?"
Darryl Strawberry,"Well, I've never met you, but... yes."
,
Homer Simpson,It's not fair. Me and the guys worked so hard to get to the championship game and now we'll be sitting on a bench.
Marge Simpson,You hit so many home runs this year. What makes you think this Darryl Strawberry character is better than you?
Homer Simpson,"Marge, forget it. He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do."
Bart Simpson,You make me sick Homer. You're the one who told me I could do anything if I just put my mind to it.
Homer Simpson,"Well now that you're a little bit older, I can tell you that's a crock. No matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you."
Bart Simpson,"Gotcha. Can't win, don't try."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"As your new manager, I want to say this up front. No one is assured a spot in the starting line-up. I don't care if your name is Steve Sax, Darryl Strawberry, or... Smithers, what's one of the bad players' names?"
Waylon Smithers,"Homer Simpson, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Or Homer Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Secondly, instead of beer, from now on you will all be drinking this!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"It's a brain and nerve tonic. Rich in proteids and electromagnetic juices. It promotes robust health. Of course, it has been known to cause gigantism, but only in rare cases. Try some."
KEN GRIFFEY JR.,Wow! It's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. Now, let's begin our training, shall we? Smithers -- the medicine balls."
Waylon Smithers,"What are you going to do with your million dollars, sir?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I don't know. Throw it on the pile, I suppose."
Hypnotist,You are all very good players.
ALL THE PLAYERS,We are all very good players.
Hypnotist,You will beat Shelbyville.
ALL THE PLAYERS,We will beat Shelbyville.
Hypnotist,You will give one hundred and ten percent.
ALL THE PLAYERS,That's impossible no one can give more than one hundred percent. By definition that is the most any one can give.
Homer Simpson,I got it! I got it!
Darryl Strawberry,Yes!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I called for that!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Put a lid on it, Simpson. There's no ""I"" in ""team""."
Darryl Strawberry,"Some of these guys have a bad attitude, skip."
C. Montgomery Burns,"They sure do, Strawberry."
,
Roger Clemens,"Wait a minute, are you Ken Griffey Jr.?"
Homer Simpson,No.
Carl Carlson,"Hey Scioscia, I don't get it. You're a ringer but you're here every night, in the core, bustin' your butt haulin' radioactive waste."
Mike Scioscia,"Well Carl, it's such a relief from the pressures of playing big league ball. I mean, there you make any kind of mistake and boom, the press is all over you."
Mike Scioscia,Uh-oh.
Carl Carlson,"Ah, don't worry about it."
Mike Scioscia,"Oh man, is this ever sweet."
,
KEN GRIFFEY JR.,Pick me! Pick me!
Ralph Wiggum,I pick Ken Griffey Jr.
Bart Simpson,"Aw geez... okay, I'll take Milhouse."
Ralph Wiggum,"Hey, Mr. Boggs! Will you be on my team?"
Wade Boggs,You got yourself a player.
Bart Simpson,"Damn! All right, I'll take Lewis."
Ralph Wiggum,I'll take Jose Canseco.
Bart Simpson,

C. Montgomery Burns,Mattingly! Get rid of those sideburns!
Don Mattingly,What sideburns?
C. Montgomery Burns,"You heard me, hippy."
C. Montgomery Burns,Mattingly! Get rid of those sideburns.
Don Mattingly,What sideburns?
C. Montgomery Burns,"You heard me, hippie."
Homer Simpson,"These guys aren't so tough. I've got ""Wonder Bat."""
Homer Simpson,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Take a knee boys.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Tomorrow is the biggest day of your lives. The Shelbyville game. So lights out at seven-thirty and abstain from coffee, tea, and cola drinks. Make no mistake, they pack a wallop."
Darryl Strawberry,"Sure do, Skip."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes. Now, before I post the starting line-up I want to assure those of you whose names are not on the list, that I'm very disappointed in you. Something was lacking, let's call it heart."
Darryl Strawberry,"No hustle either, Skip."
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's right, Darryl."
Lenny Leonard,"Aw, nuts!"
Homer Simpson,"Please, please, please, I want to make the team. Clemens, did I make the team?"
Roger Clemens,You sure did.
Roger Clemens,"Sorry, I didn't mean to get your hopes up."
Homer Simpson,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, there's no way I can lose this bet. Unless, of course, my nine all-stars fall victim to nine separate misfortunes and are unable to play tomorrow. But that will never happen. Three misfortunes, that's possible. Seven misfortunes, there's an outside chance. But nine misfortunes... I'd like to see that."

Steve Sax,What a nice little town. Maybe I'll buy a home here when I retire.
Steve Sax,"What seems to be the problem, officers?"
Eddie,"That's enough out of you, smart guy."
Lou,Reach for your license... slowly.
Eddie,"Well well, Steve Sax from New York City."
Lou,"I heard some guy got killed in New York City, and they never solved the case. But you wouldn't know anything about that -- now would you Steve?"
Steve Sax,But there's hundreds of unsolved murders in New York City.
Lou,"You don't know when to keep your mouth shut, do you Saxy boy?"

Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Uh, Mike, try to lift your arm."
Mike Scioscia,Can't... lift... arm... or... speak... at... normal... rate.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, I'm afraid you have a case of acute radiation poisoning, Mr. Scioscia."
Mike Scioscia,Will... I... be... able... to... play... softball... tomorrow?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"No, by tomorrow you'll barely be able to breathe."
Mike Scioscia,Oh... man.
Nurse,"Dr. Hibbert, Ken Griffey, Jr. needs to see you immediately. We think it's an overdose of nerve tonic."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Good Lord! Gigantism!

Ozzie Smith,How long does it take to see this thing? I'm kind of in a hurry.

Ozzie Smith,Wow! One please.
Ticket Taker,
,
Homer Simpson,Where do you think you're going?
Lisa Simpson,To the game.
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no! I don't want you to see me sitting on my butt."
Bart Simpson,"We've seen it, dad."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Mattingly, for the last time, get rid of those sideburns!"
Don Mattingly,"Look, Mr. Burns. I don't know what you think sideburns are, but..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Don't argue with me! Just get rid of them.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, it's almost game time. Where the devil are my ringers?"
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, Mike Socioscia may not live through the night. Steve Sax is looking at six consecutive life sentences. And Ozzie Smith seems to have vanished off the face of the earth."
C. Montgomery Burns,What about Conseco?
,
Woman,The dryer goes on the right.
JOSE CONSECO,Yes ma'am.
C. Montgomery Burns,What about Clemens?
Waylon Smithers,Sir... he's in no condition to play.
Roger Clemens,"Brock, bock, bock, bock. Brock, bock, bock, bock."
C. Montgomery Burns,That damn hypnotist!
C. Montgomery Burns,"You, look what you've done! My starting pitcher thinks he's a chicken! Make no mistake, I'm going to report this to the American Hypnotical Association."
Hypnotist,But I did a good job... a gooood job.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh well, I guess it's not your fault... you did a good job."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Mattingly, I thought I told you to trim those sideburns. Go home! You're off the team! For good!"
Don Mattingly,Fine. I still like him better than Steinbrenner.
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, you rag-tag bunch of misfits. You hate me, and I hate you even more. But without my beloved ringers, you're all I've got. So I want you to remember some inspiring things that someone else may have told you in the course of your lives, and go out there and win!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Not so fast, Simpson."
C. Montgomery Burns,The man who plays your position is still here. Hit the pine.
Lisa Simpson,You stink Strawberry. We want Home-run Homer!
Bart Simpson,"Dar-ryl, Dar-ryl."
Lisa Simpson,"Dar-ryl, Dar-ryl."
Marge Simpson,"Children, that's not very nice."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, they're professional athletes. They're used to this sort of thing. It rolls right off their backs."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, Monty, it's up to you managerial skills. What to do. Smithers, massage my brain."
Waylon Smithers,"Yes, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You! Strawberry, hit a home run."
Darryl Strawberry,"Okay, Skip!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I told him to do that.
Waylon Smithers,"Brilliant strategy, sir."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, dear."
Marge Simpson,"Children, tell me when your father stops scratching himself. Kids?"
Bart Simpson,"We'll tell ya, mom."
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, tie game. Bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, Strawberry coming up..."
Homer Simpson,"They're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me."
C. Montgomery Burns,Wait! You! Strawberry! Good effort today. Take a lap and hit the showers. I'm putting in a right-handed batter to hit for you.
Waylon Smithers,What?
Darryl Strawberry,You're pinch-hitting for me?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes. You see, you're a left-hander. And so is the pitcher. If I send up a right-handed batter, it's called playing the percentages. It's what smart managers do to win ballgames."
Darryl Strawberry,But I've got nine home runs today.
C. Montgomery Burns,You should be very proud of yourself. Sit down! Simpson! You're batting for Strawberry.
Homer Simpson,I am? Whoo-hoo!
Carl Carlson,"Atta boy, Homer."
Lenny Leonard,You can do it.
Roger Clemens,"Brock, bock, bock, bock, bock!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, Simpson, let's go over the signals."
C. Montgomery Burns,If I tug the bill of my cap like so...
Homer Simpson,Yes.
C. Montgomery Burns,...it means the signal is a fake.
Homer Simpson,Uh uh.
C. Montgomery Burns,"However, I can take that off by dusting my hands thusly."
Homer Simpson,Got it.
C. Montgomery Burns,"If I want you to bunt, I will touch my belt buckle not once, not twice, but thrice..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Got that Simpson?
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir!"
P.A. Announcer,"Now batting for Darryl Strawberry, Homer Simpson."
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Marge Simpson,"Oh, dear."
Lisa Simpson,"No mom, it counts as a hit. Dad just won the game."

Homer Simpson,We always have one good kid and one lousy kid. Why can't both our kids be good?
Marge Simpson,"We have three kids, Homer."
Homer Simpson,Maaarge... The dog doesn't count as a kid.
Marge Simpson,"No, Maggie!"
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.
,
Miss Hoover,"Now, take some paste and spread it on the construction paper. Ralph, are you eating your paste?"
Ralph Wiggum,"No, Miss Hoover."
Miss Hoover,"Good. Now, sprinkle your sparkles on your paste. Lisa, you're not sprinkling your sparkles."
Lisa Simpson,Shove it.
Miss Hoover,
Seymour Skinner,"I have never seen a good student take such a slide. Lisa, what are you rebelling against?"
Lisa Simpson,Whattaya got?
,
Donna,"And she goes, ""Lisa told Hoover to shove it"" and I'm like, ""No way!"" And she's like, ""Fraid so,"" and I'm all, ""Whooah!"", and she's like..."
Tammy,"Hey, Lisa, man. I'm like, so impressed. When I was in second grade, I was all ""Hi, there, I'm so good."" Want a smoke?"
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, I'll smoke it in class."
Donna,Whoa.
,
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, you're doing a bang-up job. You know, before there were some corridors of this school you'd just never go down. Now I feel safe anywhere."
Bart Simpson,"Every day is a new fight, sir."
Lisa Simpson,"Come on, Bart. In your pre-Fascist days, you knew the giddy thrill of futile rebellion."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, the school is a police state. Students are afraid to sneeze. And I have you to thank. Come with me."
,
Bart Simpson,Madre de Dios! The legends were true!
Seymour Skinner,"Yes Bart, whenever a teacher confiscates something it ends up here. Salacious halter-tops, complete collections of Mad, Cracked and the occasional issue of Crazy, and this fake plastic derriere."
Bart Simpson,
Seymour Skinner,"Now, to show my gratitude, I want you to help yourself to an item of your choice."
Bart Simpson,All-riight!
Seymour Skinner,"Ooo, now, you be careful with that crossbow."
Bart Simpson,I will.
Bart Simpson,"Seymour, this is an absent slip signed by Nelson's mother. And this is Nelson's English homework. Notice the identical elongated loops on the d's."
Seymour Skinner,Forgery. So he didn't have leprosy.
,
Former Teacher,This is a great day for me. I thought I could never teach again.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, Things have changed. There will be no mockery of your name, Mr. Glasscock."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey Lewis, watch this."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Ow! Bart, do something."
Bart Simpson,"Let's go, Milhouse."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Sure, we have order. But at what price!"
,
Miss Hoover,"Now let's correct our homework exercises. Lisa, what nineteenth century figure was nicknamed ""Old Hickory""?"
Lisa Simpson,I don't know. You?
Miss Hoover,"Lisa, if you'd bothered to do the assignment you'd know the answer is..."
Miss Hoover,"The Battle of New Orleans. I mean, Andrew Jackson."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, you're earning your eighteen grand a year."
Lisa Simpson,Stupid Hoover... thinks she's so smart.
Lisa Simpson,She wouldn't be so smart without her Teacher's edition.
Lisa Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,Yeah!
Seymour Skinner,"Ladies and gentlemen, the unthinkable has happened. Some sick, twisted individual has stolen every teacher's edition in this school."
Teacher #1,What'll we do?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Declare a snowday!
Teacher #2,Does anyone know the multiplication table?
Seymour Skinner,"Please, please, don't panic! They can smell fear."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Children, I know this is highly irregular, but for the rest of the uh, day Martin will be teaching this class."
Martin Prince,I will? But I wouldn't know where to begin.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Just do it, Brainiac."
Hippie Teacher,Have I ever told you kids about the sixties?
Miss Hoover,I've... got... to get... out... of... here!
Miss Hoover,Calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean.
,
Former Teacher,I'm leaving the profession again.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh now Mr. Glasscock, please reconsider."
Former Teacher,Hunh-uh.
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, the police haven't had any luck finding the teachers' editions."
,
Chief Wiggum,The dogs have picked up the scent of books.
Chief Wiggum,Send in the battering ram.
Eddie,Here we go!
Seymour Skinner,We're going to have to re-order every book.
Bart Simpson,"Seymour, I'll bet you a steak dinner those books are still here. All we have to do is search every locker."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, Bart, I'm not sure random locker searches are permitted by the Supreme Court..."
Bart Simpson,"Pfft, Supreme Court. What have they done for us lately?"
Seymour Skinner,Let's move.
,
Seymour Skinner,Hmm...
Seymour Skinner,Bah.
,
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Lisa.
Lisa Simpson,That's right. It was I.
Bart Simpson,"Lis, why did you do it?"
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but even I had my limits. You're looking at expulsion for this."
Lisa Simpson,I know. I know.
Seymour Skinner,The books!
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, answers! Answers! Simpson, you've just saved the school one hundred and twenty dollars. Who's behind this monstrous crime?"
Bart Simpson,I am.
Lisa Simpson,
,
Seymour Skinner,"I've been so blind. In retrospect, the signs all pointed to a rogue hall monitor."
Bart Simpson,"Sorry if I betrayed your trust, Principal Sucker."
Seymour Skinner,"D'oh. Now Bart, in light of your recent service to the school, I've decided to be lenient. Four hundred days detention."
Bart Simpson,Four hundred days. I can do that standing on my head.
Seymour Skinner,"All right, five hundred days."
Bart Simpson,"Oooh, big man."
Seymour Skinner,Six hundred days.
Bart Simpson,Maybe I'll just shut my big mouth.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Let's go, Simpson."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, why'd you take the blame?"
Bart Simpson,"'Cause I didn't want you to wreck your life. You got the brains and the talent to go as far as you want. And when you do, I'll be right there to borrow money."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Bart."
,
Bart Simpson,"Soundin' good, Lis!"
Employee,I don't need your crummy job Mr. Employer! I won the lottery!
Employer,"Well, who needs employees? I won the lottery too!"
Window Washers,We both won the lottery!
Window Washers,"Why don't you win the lottery, too?"
Announcer,The State Lottery. Where everybody wins. Actual odds of winning -- one in three hundred eighty million.
,
Moe Szyslak,"Pfft, the lottery. Exploiter of the poor and ignorant."
Barney Gumble,"You know, I heard the jackpot's up to one hundred and thirty million dollars."
Homer Simpson,One hundred and thirty million dollars!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes, yes, here's your lottery ticket. Thank you for knocking over my inventory. Please come again."
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I need some lucky numbers, fast! How old are you? Uh-huh, and what's your birthday? No kidding. And what's Lisa's birthday?... What? You don't know your sister's birthday? What kind of brother are you?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Strap on your bullet proof vest, Sanjay. It's time for another bank run."
Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon,"All right, but if I don't make it, promise you won't sleep with my wife."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I promise nothing.
,
Homer Simpson,You'll never guess what happened Marge! Are you ready? I... have... a feeling... that we may win... the lottery!
Marge Simpson,But we never ever...
Homer Simpson,"I know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully. Go-get-all-your-money..."
Marge Simpson,I buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon. We each play our birthday. And that's enough excitement for me.
Homer Simpson,"You don't understand, Marge. The lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. Uh, the lottery and you."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, we're on a tight budget here. Promise me you won't get carried away."
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Money... I mean Honey. Ooooh! Here comes a news report about the lottery!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, down in front."
Kent Brockman,The whole state is suddenly in the grip of lottery fever. And Springfield is no exception.
,
Kent Brockman,"In fact, every copy of Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" has been checked out from the Springfield Public Library."
,
Kent Brockman,"Of course, the book does not contain any hints on how to win the lottery. It is, rather, a chilling tale of conformity gone mad."
,
Kent Brockman,"But there's already one big winner. Our state's school system, which gets fully half the profits from the lottery."
Marge Simpson,You can still win some money if you have five out of six.
Homer Simpson,Whoo-hoo!
Seymour Skinner,Just think what we can buy with that money. History books that know how the Korean War came out. Math books that don't have that Base six crap in them.
Seymour Skinner,"And a state of the art detention hall, where children are held in place with magnets."
Teacher #1,Magnets. Always with the magnets.
,
Homer Simpson,I've never been so sure of anything in my life. I am going to win this lottery.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, the odds are three hundred and eighty million to one."
Homer Simpson,"Correction. Three hundred and eighty million to fifty. So what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?"
Bart Simpson,Put it in the bank.
Lisa Simpson,Give it to the poor.
Homer Simpson,What do kids know about spending money?
Bart Simpson,"What are you gonna do, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,Hmm...
Lenny Leonard,"Hey Homer, what'd you do? Get a haircut or something?"
Homer Simpson,"Look closer, Lenny!"
Lenny Leonard,Oh I know what it is. You're the biggest man in the world now. And you're covered in gold.
Homer Simpson,Fourteen carat gold!
,
Homer Simpson,"Take a hike boss, I'm running things now."
C. Montgomery Burns,All hail king Homer!
,
,
Kent Brockman,We now take you to the drawing live -- I hope you've got your tickets. I've got mine.
,
Lou,"They're about to start, Chief."
Chief Wiggum,"No, you've got the wrong number. This is nine one two."
,
Krusty the Clown,"We'll be with you in a minute, kids. This could be our ticket outta here, Mel."
,
Lottery Announcer,I will now draw the first winning number.
,
Homer Simpson,I've got so many tickets I can't lose!
Lottery Announcer,The first number is... seventeen.
Lottery Announcer,And the second number is... three.
Homer Simpson,"Receipts, ugh."
Grampa Simpson,"Yeah, I knew we wouldn't win."
Homer Simpson,"Well why didn't you tell the rest of us? Why did you keep it a secret??? If you were seventeen, we'd be rich! But no! You had to be ""10."""
Lottery Announcer,And the final number is... forty-nine.
Kent Brockman,Thirty-eight... forty-nine... Ohmigod! I won! I won!
Kent Brockman,"Recapping our day's top story -- the winner of today's state lottery is me, Kent Brockman! Can we get a shot of me?"
Kent Brockman,There you go.
Kent Brockman,In other news... uh... a tragic mix-up today in Cleveland... many people killed... uh... Goodbye.
Marge Simpson,"Oh well... we lost the money, but at least we've still got each other."
Grampa Simpson,"Hey, the dog's dead."
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Grampa, he's not dead!"
Homer Simpson,"Dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not."
Lisa Simpson,It's not fair to toy with people's emotions like that.
Grampa Simpson,He is dead! I'll get a shovel.
Marge Simpson,"Well, he's not dead, but he is awfully sick."
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, sure! The old man's off his rocker. If Grampa says he's dead he must be alive."
Lisa Simpson,He is alive. He's wagging his tail.
Grampa Simpson,That don't mean nothin'! Dogs wag their tails for hours after they die. I'm tired of this conversation. Let's talk about something else. I'm going home.
,
,
Vet,Clear! Ugh... Clear!
Nurse,Doctor... he's gone.
Vet,This is the part of the job I hate.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you did the best you could."
Vet,"I love animals. I spend my life saving them and they can't thank me. Well... the parrots can -- but, anyway let's see what's wrong with this little fella."
Vet,I'm afraid that your dog has a twisted stomach. He needs an operation to correct it or he'll die.
,
Marge Simpson,"Hmm, how much will it cost?"
Vet,Seven hundred and fifty dollars.
Marge Simpson,Oh dear!
Vet,This is never an easy decision. It's an awful lot of money.
Homer Simpson,Well... I guess we'll have to talk it over.
Bart Simpson,Talk what over? What's there to talk about?
Bart Simpson,What are we going to talk over?
Krusty the Clown,Mr. Teeny needs a refill of his nicotine gum.
,
Bart Simpson,I can't help but notice we're leaving the hospital. When's the dog going to get his operation?
Homer Simpson,"Uh... later. First, I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... Doggie Heaven."
,
Homer Simpson,"In Doggie Heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! And all the best dogs are there. Old Yeller... and about eight Lassies and..."
Bart Simpson,Is there a Doggie Hell?
Homer Simpson,Well... of course. There couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
Bart Simpson,Who's in there?
Homer Simpson,Uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had... whassisname... uh... Chester.
Lisa Simpson,Checkers.
Homer Simpson,Yeah. And one of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one. The one that mauled Timmy.
Bart Simpson,"Hey! Wait a minute, does this have anything to do with Santa's Little Helper?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, honey. Seven-hundred and fifty dollars is a lot of money. We really can't afford this operation."
Bart Simpson,You're gonna just let him die?
Marge Simpson,I know you're upset --
Bart Simpson,Darn right I'm upset!
Marge Simpson,"Bart, watch your language. Oh. You did. Sorry."
Bart Simpson,We are not going to let our dog die! And that's IT! Lousy dog-killing sonsa...
Homer Simpson,But it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach...
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on! I'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. Marge, make him stop."
Lisa Simpson,"Thanks, Mom."
Homer Simpson,All right. All right. We'll find a way. Lousy manipulative dog.
,
Homer Simpson,Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Please, do go on..."
Homer Simpson,I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, please, continue..."
Homer Simpson,I thought maybe you...
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, thanks for your time."
C. Montgomery Burns,"What makes a man endanger his job, and yes, even his life, by asking me for money?"
Waylon Smithers,"People like dogs, Mr. Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say?"
Waylon Smithers,"Uh... if YOU did it, sir?..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Exactly! You'd be fit to be tied! Dogs!
,
Marge Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,What?
Marge Simpson,You are NOT going to perform that operation yourself.
Homer Simpson,But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey.
Homer Simpson,"Maybe you're right, Marge."
Marge Simpson,I've found a way we can pay for the operation.
Homer Simpson,"Whattaya got, Marge? Insurance scam?"
Marge Simpson,"No. I'm afraid we're just going to have to make a few sacrifices. Homer, you're going to have to give up beer for a while."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, from now on you'll have to get your hair cut for free at Springfield Barber College."
Bart Simpson,No problemo.
Marge Simpson,"I'm going to give up buying my weekly lottery ticket, and I found a way to stretch the food budget. Fried chicken night will now be organ meat night. Ham night will be Spam night. And porkchop night..."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,... will now be chub night.
Homer Simpson,Chub? I don't even know what that is!
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, I'm afraid we'll have to stop getting you those volumes of Encyclopedia Generica from the grocery store."
Lisa Simpson,"But, Mom, next week is volume four: Copernicus through Elephantiasis."
Marge Simpson,"We all have to make sacrifices, dear. Maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer..."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats..."
Marge Simpson,I don't think you've thought this through.
,
Nurse,"Good news, Mr. Danielson, we saved your gamecock. But I'm afraid he'll never fight again."
Mr. Danielson,That's what you think. He'll fight and he'll win!
Vet,Clamp. Wipe... No! No!
God,"Come to the light, boy. Come into the light. Come on now. There's a good boy. Come on. Come on."
Nurse,Um... Simpson?
Vet,It's times like this I'm glad I flunked out of dental school.
,
Homer Simpson,"Lousy chub night. Hey, how come he gets meat and we don't?"
Marge Simpson,You wouldn't want what he's eating. It's mostly just snouts and entrails.
Homer Simpson,Mmm... snouts.
Kent Brockman,"Yes, I'm back. Kent Brockman is not the kind of a man who would leave a $500,000 a year job just because he won a lottery. Hey, I'm a journalist."
Homer Simpson,"Well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy."
Marge Simpson,What's that?
Homer Simpson,A dinosaur.
Kent Brockman,"Of course I'm not the only one who benefited from last week's big payoff. Our state's schools got their share too. Here, lottery officials present Springfield Elementary with a brand new eraser."
Seymour Skinner,"One eraser? Oh, I'm used to my government betraying me. I was in Nam. I served for three --"
Kent Brockman,"And speaking of lotteries, here are the winning numbers for this week's forty-thousand dollar ""jackpot"": 3 - 6 - 17 - 18 - 22 and 29."
Marge Simpson,"Oh no! Those are my numbers! If it wasn't for that dog, I would've won!"
,
Miss Hoover,"Class, for tomorrow, I want you to write a report on Copernicus."
Lisa Simpson,
Sadistic Barfly,"C'mon boozehound! You want the twenty five cents, don't you? Keep singin'!"
Homer Simpson,BUFFALO GALS WON'T YOU COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT... OH BUFFALO GALS...
Young Barfly,Who's that old rummy?
Moe Szyslak,"Before his dog got sick, that ""old rummy"" used to be my best customer."
Homer Simpson,AND DANCE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOONNNNNNNN!
Sadistic Barfly,"Go get it, pal."
Homer Simpson,My quarter!!!
,
Trainee,"Okay, I'll just even this out and."
Trainee,Mr. Laswell! I've done it again.
,
Homer Simpson,"I know you can't understand me, but you're a lousy dog and I hate you."
Marge Simpson,Not now.
Lisa Simpson,Can't you see I'm reading a third-rate biography of Copernicus I found at the bus station?
Bart Simpson,Dumb dog.
Marge Simpson,"Homie, did you close the gate?"
Homer Simpson,Yes.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you mean tonight."
Marge Simpson,The dog will get out!
Homer Simpson,Bart! Close the gate.
Bart Simpson,Lisa! Close the gate.
Lisa Simpson,"Close the gate, Maggie."
Marge Simpson,Here boy!
Bart Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Here Santa's Little Helper!
Bart Simpson,It's all my fault. I called him a dumb dog.
Homer Simpson,Oh he's gone and he's never coming back. Wait! There he is. No... that's a horse.
,
,
Lisa Simpson,Have you found a picture yet?
Marge Simpson,Not one that I want the public to see.
,
Ned Flanders,... So recycling is our way of giving Mother Earth a great big hug.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, it does sound like fun. I can't wait to start pawing through my garbage like some starving raccoon."
Marge Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Release the hounds. Well, neighbor I see you've got your running shoes on. That's a good thing."
C. Montgomery Burns,What's wrong with Crippler?
Waylon Smithers,"He's getting on, sir. He's been here since the late sixties."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah yes, I'll never forget the day he bagged his first hippie. That young man didn't think it was too ""groovy."""
,
C. Montgomery Burns,I'm looking for something in an attack dog. One who likes the sweet gamy tang of human flesh.
C. Montgomery Burns,Why here's the fellow! Wiry... fast... firm proud buttocks. Reminds me of me.
Homer Simpson,Uh...the last one.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now! As an attack dog, you'll be expected to neutralize intruders."
Waylon Smithers,Wanna buy some cookies? Wanna buy some cookies?
C. Montgomery Burns,If that were a real Girl Scout I'd have been bothered by now.
Barney Gumble,"I know how you feel, I lost my dog too. He's in here somewhere."
C. Montgomery Burns,Now here's a film that will turn you into a vicious souless killer. Enjoy.
,
Lisa Simpson,Poor Santa's Little Helper. I'm starting to think we'll never see him again.
Homer Simpson,"That was his dish, and that was his leash, and that's where he took a whiz on the rug."
Marge Simpson,"Homer get a-hold of yourself. Even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry. Remember Doggie Heaven."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge! There is no such place!"
Homer Simpson,Or... to put it another way... there is.
Bart Simpson,I'm not giving up. I don't care if I have to knock on every door in this two-bit town. I'm gonna find my dog.
Homer Simpson,And I'll be right here watching TV.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Poke-A Poke-A Poke-A! Poke-A Poke-A Poke-A!
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent!
,
Kent Brockman,"Hello, I'm Kent Brockman."
Bart Simpson,"Um, excuse me sir, I lost my dog."
Homer Simpson,Two tickets for...
Ticket Man,"Let me guess. ""Look Who's Oinking""?"
Kent Brockman,"Hmm huh. And I suppose you want me to buy you a new one. You know, ever since I won the lottery, everybody wants a piece of Kent Brockman. Homeless this, and hungry that."
Bart Simpson,"Gee, I'm sorry mister."
Butler,"Sir, your llama just bit Ted Kennedy."
Kent Brockman,Good.
,
Waylon Smithers,"I, uh. I hate to interrupt your longevity treatment, sir. But there's a sweet little boy at the door."
C. Montgomery Burns,Release the hounds.
Bart Simpson,Santa's Little Helper! It's you! AAAGGGHHH!!
Bart Simpson,What's the matter boy? Don't you know me? I'm your buddy!
Bart Simpson,"I love ya, boy."
,
Homer Simpson,Let me pet him again!
Lisa Simpson,You already petted him for ten minutes.
Homer Simpson,I know. I want to pet him again!
Marge Simpson,You can pet the cat.
Homer Simpson,The cat? What's the point?
,
Lisa Simpson,"Look dad, there's a spot."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, there's a spot, dear."
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, there's a good one."
Marge Simpson,"That spot says ""compact only""."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's just a suggested car size."
Homer Simpson,Easy... easy... How'm I doing on the right?
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, we're getting a lot of sparks over here, dad."
Homer Simpson,"Uh huh... easy... easy... perfect. All right, everybody out the window."
,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, they all look great."
Marge Simpson,"So, what are we going to see?"
Bart Simpson,Ernest Cuts The Cheese!
Lisa Simpson,"""Honey, I Hit A School Bus""!"
Homer Simpson,"Look Who's Oinking! ""Look Who's Oinking""!"
Marge Simpson,"Well, since we'll never agree, why don't you kids pick a movie, your dad and I will pick a movie, then we'll all meet in the lobby later. Hmm?"
Homer Simpson,That's right.
Ticket Man,Sold out.
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Maybe we could see something a little more adult.
Homer Simpson,"Why Marge, you frisky little devil."
Homer Simpson,"We'll take two tickets to ""The Stockholm Affair."""
Marge Simpson,"Ooh! The paper called it a ""taut political thriller""."
Homer Simpson,Political!
,
General,"Mr. President, disturbing news. Serious cracks are developing in the Greco-Bolivian Alliance."
President,Get me Jed Kolick!
Homer Simpson,"Ah, this movie's too complicated... Hey, the floor's sticky..."
Homer Simpson,"Who's that guy?... What did that guy say when I said, ""Who's that guy?"""
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that submarine's so fake... Look, you can see the strings... Ooh! An octopus!"
Homer Simpson,What?
,
Bart Simpson,"If you don't watch the violence, you'll never get desensitized to it."
Lisa Simpson,Just tell me when the scary part's over.
Bart Simpson,It's over.
,
Homer Simpson,I think that guy's a spy.
Marge Simpson,Well of course he's a spy. You just saw him go through spy school!
Homer Simpson,"Oh wait, I heard how this ends. It turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it's pretty obvious if you think about it."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, shut up, Homer! No one wants to hear what you think!"
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, if it makes you feel any better, most of what they threw at you splattered on me. Homer?..."
Bart Simpson,"Forget it, mom. Dad's really mad. The tendons are throbbing at the base of his neck..."
Bart Simpson,And stress is collecting in the trouble spots here... here... and here... Making for one unhappy pappy.
Homer Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Homie, aren't you coming inside?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. Tonight you robbed me of it. I'm going now and I don't know when you'll see me again."
Lisa Simpson,I guess that executive stress ball we got him for Christmas isn't working.
,
Homer Simpson,Mmm...
Homer Simpson,"Ew, a skunk!"
Homer Simpson,Oh no.
,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a redneck bar."
,
Cowboy #1,"Hey, you, let's fight!"
Cowboy #2,Them's fightin' words!
Homer Simpson,Duff please.
Bartender,We don't sell Duff. We sell Fudd.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Fudd me."
Bar Owner,"All right, all right, uh, ladies and gentlemen, he's all healed up and he's back for more. Let's give a big drunken welcome to Yodelin' Zeke!"
Yodelin' Zeke,Yodel-lay-hee... Yodel-lay-hee... Yodel-lay-hee -- Arrgh!
Bar Owner,"Our next act is our very own singin' waitress, Lurleen!"
Bar Owner,"... So, I'm afraid drink service will stop for just a few moments while she --"
Bar Owner,They're all yours.
Homer Simpson,Stupid Marge tell me to shut up.
Lurleen Lumpkin,Thank you. Tonight I'd like to try something a little different. It's a song I wrote while I was moppin' up your dried blood and teeth.
Lurleen Lumpkin,YOU WORK ALL DAY FOR SOME OLD MAN/ SWEAT AND BREAK YOUR BACK/
Homer Simpson,Yeah...
Lurleen Lumpkin,THEN YOU GO HOME TO YOUR CASTLE/ BUT YOUR QUEEN WON'T CUT YOU SLACK/
Homer Simpson,... that's true.
Lurleen Lumpkin,THAT'S WHY YOU'RE LOSIN' ALL YOUR HAIR/... THAT'S WHY YOU'RE OVERWEIGHT/...
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.
Lurleen Lumpkin,THAT'S WHY YOU FLIPPED YOUR PICK-UP TRUCK RIGHT OFF THE INTERSTATE/...
Homer Simpson,"That's right, except for the pick-up truck."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. I went to this bar the other night, and they..."
Moe Szyslak,Wha...wha... Wait a minute. You went to another bar?
Lurleen Lumpkin,"THERE'S A LOT OF BULL THEY HAND YOU/ THERE'S NOTHIN' YOU CAN DO/ YOUR WIFE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO/ NO, YOUR WIFE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO/ I SAID NO ONE UNDERSTANDS YOU/ BUT I DO/"
Homer Simpson,"Hey... Hey, Lurleen! I've gotta say somethin' to ya."
Lurleen Lumpkin,I'm listenin'.
Homer Simpson,Your song touched me in a way I've never felt before. And which way to the can?
,
Lurleen Lumpkin,"So what's your name, stranger?"
Homer Simpson,Homer J. Simpson.
Lurleen Lumpkin,My name's Lurleen Lumpkin.
Homer Simpson,That's a pretty name.
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Oh, you think so?"
Homer Simpson,Maybe. I'm not sure. I forgot it.
Homer Simpson,Bye Lurleen.
Lurleen Lumpkin,"So long, Homer J. Simpson."
,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.
Marge Simpson,Where were you all night?
Homer Simpson,I was just up at this bar in Spittle County.
Marge Simpson,You should have called. I was very worried.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, let's end this feudin' and a fussin' and get down to some lovin'."
Marge Simpson,

Homer Simpson,I WORK ALL DAY FOR SOME OLD MAN/ I SWEAT AND BREAK MY BACK/

Nurse,"Doctor, you weren't supposed to remove his gall bladder."
Male Nurse,Put it back! Put it back!

Homer Simpson,YOUR WIFE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO...
Lenny Leonard,Gheee... Homer's singing to his ball again.
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, and he's bowling a two-eighty."
Lenny Leonard,Oh yeah. THERE'S A KIND OF HUSH/ ALL OVER THE WORLD TONIGHT...
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Moe, you got any Fudd?"
Moe Szyslak,Fudd? I thought they took that off the market after all those hillbillies went blind.
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I was a hundred miles outta town."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, Homer."
,
,
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Well, if it isn't Homer J. Simpson."
Homer Simpson,"Lurleen, I can't get your song outta my mind. I haven't felt this way since ""Funky Town."""
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Oh, aren't you sweet."
Homer Simpson,Do you think I could get a copy of it?
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Sorry, darlin', all my songs are up here. ""I'm Bastin' a Turkey With My Tears"", ""Don't Look Up My Dress Unless You Mean It"", ""I'm Sick of Your Lyin' Lips and False Teeth""..."
Homer Simpson,"Lurleen, we've gotta crack open your head and scoop out those songs!"
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Well, I don't know."
Homer Simpson,Come with me!
Lurleen Lumpkin,Oh!
,
Lurleen Lumpkin,"I SAID NO ONE UNDERSTANDS YOU, BUT I DOOO."
Music Store Owner,"Listen ma'am, my brother owns a radio station over in Weevilville, and with your permission, I'd like to take your CD to him."
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Homer, it's your quarter, what do you say?"
Homer Simpson,I guess so.
,
D.J.,This is K-U-D-D five seventy A.M.
D.J.,"Hey, don't touch that dial -- you've got KUDD on it."
Moe Szyslak,"For the next half hour, beer's on the house."
Barney Gumble,"What'd you say, Moe?"
Moe Szyslak,Nothin'.
Krusty the Clown,I thought I told you to stay away from my sister!
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, here's fifty bucks. Take her to the Copa."
Snake Jailbird,It's payback time!
Snake Jailbird,"Aww... puts this whole riot into perspective, doesn't it?"
,
Lisa Simpson,She's wonderful. I could feel her sweet country soul in every digitally-encoded bit.
Bart Simpson,Country music sucks. All it does is take precious air space away from shock DJ's whose cruelty and profanity amuse us all.
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, boy. Marge, what do you think?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, it's nice. But who is this woman?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress. But she's going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady."
Marge Simpson,I don't like you hanging around with some cocktail waitress!
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you make it sound so seamy. All I did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on some outfits."
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Well hi, Lurleen. We were just talking about you. Uh... I think I can come over. Let me ask my wife."
Marge Simpson,
,
,
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Oh Homer, everybody's been callin'! Mamma, Daddy, the triplets, Vonda Mae, Piney Jo... and I owe it all to you."
Homer Simpson,"Don't thank me, Lurleen, you should be thanking your brain."
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Oh Homer, no man has ever been this nice to me without... you know, wantin' somethin' in return."
Homer Simpson,"Well, I was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now I feel kinda guilty about it."
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Homer, you're just a big sack of sugar."
Homer Simpson,"Thanks. You did say sugar, right?"
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Uh-huh. Now, Homer, I want you to be my manager."
Homer Simpson,"Really? Well, I should warn you... I'm not great with figures..."
Lurleen Lumpkin,That's okay.
Homer Simpson,I make a lot of stupid decisions...
Lurleen Lumpkin,Nobody's perfect.
Homer Simpson,I did bad in school.
Lurleen Lumpkin,I didn't even go.
Homer Simpson,My personal hygiene has been described as...
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Homer, Homer, you'll be a great manager. There's only one thing you need."
,
,
Salesman,Now this is made from a space-age fabric developed especially for Elvis. Sweat actually cleans this suit!
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, look at me."
Marge Simpson,I don't want to. I'm mad at you.
Marge Simpson,"I'm sick of that waitress and all the time you've been spending with her, and this whole country music thing."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, then maybe you better not look at me."
Marge Simpson,Homer! Where did you get that suit?
Homer Simpson,A friend bought it for me.
Marge Simpson,Was it Lurleen?
Homer Simpson,No... I think it was Lenny.
Marge Simpson,Don't lie to me. Are you having an affair with this woman?
Homer Simpson,No!
Marge Simpson,Have you kissed her?
Homer Simpson,No!
Marge Simpson,Has she kissed you?
Homer Simpson,A coupla times.
Marge Simpson,I want you to stop seeing her.
Homer Simpson,I can't. I'm her manager.
Marge Simpson,Her manager? That's ridiculous. I won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer."
Marge Simpson,Your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie. And you did it at the county fair last year. Remember?
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Lurleen's gonna be a big success and whether you like it or not, I'm going to be there."
Marge Simpson,Fine. See if I care.
,
Mr. Boylan,"This studio has a lot of history. Buddy Holly stood on this spot in 1958 and said, ""There is no way in hell that I'm gonna record in this dump""."
Homer Simpson,I'm sure Lurleen will love it.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, how much did you just give that man?"
Homer Simpson,"Calm down, Marge, it's just our life savings. I'm not going to go into hock for this."
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Hey, Colonel Homer. And you must be..."
Marge Simpson,Mrs. Homer Simpson.
Lurleen Lumpkin,Charmed.
Marge Simpson,Hmmm. I thought you said she was overweight!
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen."
Marge Simpson,What does that mean?
Lurleen Lumpkin,I'M ASKIN' WILL YOU BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT?
Homer Simpson,"I don't have time to answer all these questions. Uh, time is money. Come on, people!"
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Well, c'mon boys. Let's break some hearts."
Lurleen Lumpkin,"OH THE BASES WERE EMPTY ON THE DIAMOND OF MY HEART/ WHEN THE COACH CALLED ME UP TO THE PLATE/ I'D BEEN SWINGIN' AND MISSIN' AND LOVIN' AND KISSIN'/ MY AVERAGE WAS POINT DOUBLE AUGHT EIGHT/ SO I SPIT ON MY HANDS/ KNOCKED THE DIRT FROM MY SPIKES/ AND POINTED RIGHT TOWARD CENTER FIELD/ THIS TIME I'M HITTIN' A HOME RUN/ THIS TIME LOVE IS FOR REAL/ I'LL SLIDE, I'LL STEAL,"
Bart Simpson,"Hey Dad, can I do a ham-bone solo?"
Homer Simpson,Stop it.
Lurleen Lumpkin,I'LL SACRIFICE/ A LOVING FLY FOR YOU/ I'VE BEEN SLUMPING ALL SEASON/ BUT NOW I'VE FOUND A REASON/ I STRUCK ON A LOVE THAT IS TRUE/ I USED TO PLAY THE FIELD/ I USED TO BE A ROAMER/ BUT THE SEASON'S TURNIN' 'ROUND FOR ME NOW/ I FINALLY BAGGED ME A HOMER.
Lurleen Lumpkin,THAT'S RIGHT! I FINALLY BAGGED ME A HOMER.
Mr. Boylan,"Lurleen, we're gonna have to cut you off. We're getting some kind of grinding noise on the track."
Homer Simpson,"You, off the bench."
,
Homer Simpson,"Guess what, Lurleen, I got you a gig on TV."
Lurleen Lumpkin,Oh Homer! You're as smart as you are handsome.
Homer Simpson,"Hey! Oh, you meant that as a compliment. Now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. Maybe we should give them something new."
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Well, I have been working on something that could really heat things up."
Homer Simpson,Let's hear it.
Lurleen Lumpkin,"IN THIS TRAILER, I GET SO COLD AND LONELY/ LYIN' THERE AWAKE AT NIGHT/ MUTTERING IF ONLY YOU WEREN'T MARRIED/ SO I MIGHT ASK YOU TO BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ OH BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ I'M ASKIN' WILL YOU BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's hot. There isn't a man alive who wouldn't get turned on by that. Well, g'bye."
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Uh, Homer, there's a hidden message to this song that you may have missed. Really listen. BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT..."
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh...
Lurleen Lumpkin,BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT...
Homer Simpson,Right...
Lurleen Lumpkin,That's right Homer J.
Homer Simpson,Uh... I gotta think about this.
Lurleen Lumpkin,
,
Marge Simpson,"All our money's tied up in this woman. If she fails, we're broke. If she succeeds, I have no husband. I don't know what to root for."
Patty Bouvier,You don't?
Marge Simpson,I gotta go. Homer...
Homer Simpson,"Later, Marge. Lurleen's on TV tonight. I gotta get ready."
Marge Simpson,"Just so you know, while you and Lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest, Maggie cut her first tooth."
Homer Simpson,"That's great, honey. Say, have you seen my rattlesnake hatband?"
Marge Simpson,You're not even listening to me!
Homer Simpson,Sure they will.
Marge Simpson,"Kids, will you come in here?"
Marge Simpson,"You've got a wonderful family, Homer. Please don't forget it when you walk out that door tonight."
Homer Simpson,Uh... I gotta go.
Bart Simpson,"As much as I hate that man right now, you gotta love that suit."
Announcer,Hold onto your pitch forks everybody! It's time again for...
Mule,Ya - hooooooo!
Announcer,"Starring, in alphabetical order... Yodelin' Zeke... Butterball Jackson... Freddy-boy and Yuma... Cloris Mozelle... Big Shirtless Ron... Orville and Hurley... Cathy May... Hip Diddler... Rooney!... ... The Ya-Hoo Recovering Alcoholic Jug Band... and tonight, in her syndicated TV debut... Lurleen!"
Lurleen Lumpkin,OH THE BASES WERE EMPTY...
Executive,"Excuse me, are you Colonel Homer Simpson?"
Homer Simpson,Yes I am.
Executive,"I'm from Rebel Yell Records, a division of Togasaki Corp. I'm interested in buying Lurleen's contract."
Homer Simpson,"Forget it, pal. They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy."
,
Homer Simpson,"Lurleen, they loved you."
Lurleen Lumpkin,Well thank you -- I'm still a little itchy from that fiberglass hay.
Homer Simpson,Is there anything you need?
Lisa Simpson,I'm sorry?
Lurleen Lumpkin,Well... you could make my evening complete.
Lurleen Lumpkin,What's wrong?
Homer Simpson,My whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.
Young Girl,Gross!
Girl,Thanks for dinner!
Pretty Girl,No!
Homer Simpson,At least could I have my dollar ba...
Marge Simpson,I'll love you for the rest of my life.
Homer Simpson,I'm sorry Lurleen. All I wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and I've done that. Now I better get out of here before I lose my family.
Homer Simpson,"Just so I don't wonder... You would've gone all the way with me, wouldn't you?"
Lurleen Lumpkin,Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson,Okay.
Homer Simpson,"Now before we negotiate, I have to tell you I'm desperate to unload Lurleen. And I'll take any offer."
Executive,I'll give you fifty bucks.
Homer Simpson,You son of a... Sold!
,
Orville,I caught my wife in bed with my best friend.
Hurley,You bitter?
Orville,Yeah. Bit him too.
M.C.,"And now, once again, Lurleen."
Marge Simpson,Homer?
Homer Simpson,Is there any room in that bed for a dad-burn fool?
Marge Simpson,Always has been.
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Now I'd like to play a song I wrote just this minute. It's called ""Stand By Your Manager"". HIS NAME IS HOMER/ HE'S QUITE A MAN/ I TRIED TO KISS HIM/ BUT HOMER RAN."
Lurleen Lumpkin,SURE WISH I COULD SAY/ THAT I WAS HIS/ I HOPE THAT MARGE KNOWS/ JUST HOW LUCKY SHE IS.
Marge Simpson,I do.
Dinosaur Dad,Would you turn off that rock 'n' rock music!
Dinosaur Son,"Hey, don't have a Stegosaurus, man."
,
Lisa Simpson,These talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on TV.
Homer Simpson,"Look Maggie, they have a baby, too."
Bart Simpson,It's like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen.
Marge Simpson,"Now kids, I know you're all excited about meeting Aunt Selma's new boyfriend tonight."
Homer Simpson,Pfft.
Patty Bouvier,"But I think that before he gets here, I should tell you something about him. Something... disturbing."
Lisa Simpson,Ewww.
Homer Simpson,Ooooh.
Bart Simpson,Bleuh.
Patty Bouvier,"You see, Aunt Selma has this crazy obsession about not dying alone, so in desperation, she joined this prison pen-pal program. Her new sweetie's a jailbird."
Bart Simpson,"Cool, he can teach us how to kill a man with a lunch tray."
Marge Simpson,"Now, now, he's an ex-convict. He's paid his debt to society."
Patty Bouvier,Then how come you're not using the good silverware?
Marge Simpson,I'm just not.
Marge Simpson,"That's them. Now remember everyone, be understanding and forgiving for the sake of family unity."
Selma Bouvier,"Everyone, I'd like you to meet --"
Lisa Simpson,Sideshow Bob!
Selma Bouvier,What the...?
Sideshow Bob,"Selma dear, I'm afraid the children's reaction is quite understandable."
Sideshow Bob,"You see, Bart here is the Shamus in short pants who sent me to prison."
Bart Simpson,"That's right, Aunt Selma. Your new boyfriend here framed Krusty the Clown for armed robbery."
Homer Simpson,"Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton."
Homer Simpson,Lousy snitch.
Bart Simpson,
Sideshow Bob,"Ahh, Mr. Simpson, you're forgetting the first two noble truths of the Buddha."
Homer Simpson,I am not.
Sideshow Bob,"Yes, you are. One: existence is suffering. Two: the cause of suffering is desire. In this case, my desire to do high-quality children's programming."
,
Sideshow Bob,"When prison put an end to that dream, I became a seething cauldron of rage and recrimination..."
,
Bart Simpson,"Don't be a fool, Aunt Selma. That man is scum."
Selma Bouvier,Then call me Mrs. Scum!
Sideshow Bob,"When I was nominated for best supporting performer in a children's program at the Daytime Emmy Awards, my bitterness ruined what should have been the greatest night of my life."
,
Krusty the Clown,And the Emmy goes to... I don't believe this. Sideshow Bob.
,
Sideshow Bob,"This is one more Emmy than you'll ever win, you bantering jack-in-the-box!"
Krusty the Clown,"Just don't drop that thing in the shower, Bob."
Sideshow Bob,No-talent shill!
Krusty the Clown,Second banana!
Sideshow Bob,Panderer!
Krusty the Clown,Bore!
Sideshow Bob,"Stop it, stop... release me... ."
Krusty the Clown,"Now, for the highlight of the evening... Best film-to-video transfer..."
Sideshow Bob,"Do you know what prison is like for a life-long conservative Republican? In our over-crowded cell, we became little more than beasts."
Sideshow Bob,Who used my chapstick?
Cellmate #1,"Oh, I did. Here you go."
Sideshow Bob,I don't want it.
Sideshow Bob,My only joy came with plotting a horrible revenge against the boy who put me there...
,
Bart Simpson,Aye-Carumba!
Sideshow Bob,"Bart, if I wanted to kill you, I'd have choked you like a chicken as soon as I walked in that door."
FAMILY/EVERYONE,
Sideshow Bob,But then what kind of a guest would I have been?
Sideshow Bob,"Now where was I... Ah yes, my lowest ebb."
,
Sideshow Bob,You can't take my Emmy!
Guard,"Hey, you know the rules. Awards for excellence in entertainment are contraband. No Emmys, no Oscars, not even a Golden Globe."
Sideshow Bob,But kismet can be kind as well as cruel. I received an answer to my letter from the prison pen pal program.
Selma Bouvier,White.
Bart Simpson,Knock it off.
Selma Bouvier,"Dear Number 24601, I need a man and I cannot find one among the law-abiding. I have a steady job, and a lucrative hobby filing nuisance law suits. I share an apartment with my twin sister. Enclosed is a photo of us on a tandem bike. I forget which one I am."
,
Sideshow Bob,"Dear Selma, your latest letter set off a riot in the maximum security wing of my heart."
Selma Bouvier,
,
Sideshow Bob,"Like the lone crocus that pokes through the prison yard, our love bloomed despite all obstacles."
Sideshow Bob,"Selma, may I?"
Selma Bouvier,Uh-uh-uh. On the cheek.
Sideshow Bob,"Inspired by the love of a good woman, I resolved to be the best darned inmate Number 24601 I could be."
,
Sideshow Bob,I bade farewell to my cellmates and left with the woman I loved.
Sideshow Bob,"Cutter... Ice pick... Snake, I'm going to miss you most of all."
,
Lisa Simpson,"What a beautiful story, Sideshow Bob. You're living proof that our revolving door prison system works."
Marge Simpson,"Selma, I've never seen you so happy. Giggling like a schoolgirl."
Selma Bouvier,
Patty Bouvier,"I've got to admit it, Selma. He's a once in a lifetime catch."
Sideshow Bob,"Yes, I hope the police are saying that as well."
Bart Simpson,I can't believe you guys. This man framed Krusty the Clown.
Marge Simpson,Bart!
Sideshow Bob,"Indeed, I did. And I'd like to thank you for catching me, Bart. You seized the wheel of my slow boat to hell and pointed it straight towards the sunny shores of Selma."
Homer Simpson,Hear hear!.
Sideshow Bob,"Selma, would you mind if I did something bold and shocking in front of your family?"
Selma Bouvier,"All right, but no tongues."
Sideshow Bob,"Although kissing you would be like kissing some divine ashtray, that's not what I had in mind."
Sideshow Bob,"Selma, will you marry me?"
Selma Bouvier,
Sideshow Bob,I suppose so.
Sideshow Bob,I KNOW I STAND IN LINE UNTIL I THINK YOU HAVE THE TIME TO SPEND AN EVENING WITH ME.
Selma Bouvier,AND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE TO DANCE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A CHANCE YOU WON'T BE LEAVIN' WITH ME.
Sideshow Bob,THEN AFTERWARDS WE DROP INTO A QUIET LITTLE PLACE AND HAVE A DRINK OR TWO.
Selma Bouvier,"AND THEN I GO AND SPOIL IT ALL BY SAYIN' SOMETHIN' STUPID LIKE ""I LOVE YOU""."
Selma Bouvier,Ahhh... ahhh... Hmmmm... Could you pumice my corns for me?
Sideshow Bob,Avec plaisir.
Kindly Old Gent,A... G... Q... Seven...
Selma Bouvier,Close enough. May you drive safely and find true love.
Announcer,We now return to the Twenty-seventh Annual Krusty the Clown Telethon for Motion Sickness.
Krusty the Clown,Tiffany! Woo hoo! I love you people! I love my kids! Poor little guys.
Krusty the Clown,"So tragic. So nauseous. You should see the bus they came to the studio in What's next? Oh yeah. And now, a man who needs no introduction -- the chairman of the company... you know who I'm talking about. Get out here, you goombah!"
Crooner,"Krusteleh, there's an old friend backstage who wants to say hello."
Krusty the Clown,Huh? Whuh?
Krusty the Clown,Come here you.
Sideshow Bob,"Oh... oh... oh, you old clown you."
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, I missed ya."
Sideshow Bob,This guy is a national treasure.
Krusty the Clown,"That jerk I got to replace you, he isn't fit to hold your slide whistle."
,
Sideshow Mel,All I can be is myself.
,
Sideshow Bob,"Krusty, can you ever forgive me for framing you and putting you in jail?"
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, if they ever open the books on this telethon, I'm right back in there."
Bart Simpson,That Sideshow Bob is a no-good showbiz phony.
Lisa Simpson,"Come on, Bart. If Krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him, surely you can too."
Sideshow Bob,"Oh Krusty, I can't tell you how much I missed this."
Marge Simpson,"Now, about your wedding dress. I'm not sure how to put this..."
Marge Simpson,White. And what would you like for appetizers?
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, appetizers."
Sideshow Bob,"Well Homer, you seem to be a trencherman. What should we serve?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. But brother it ain't ketchup!"
Sideshow Bob,"Well, Selma, he makes a good case."
Selma Bouvier,Get whatever you want. It all tastes like styrofoam to me.
Sideshow Bob,"Selma, dear -- I'm confused."
Selma Bouvier,"Well, when I was a kid we were playing with bottle rockets, and one shot straight up my nose. I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell."
Marge Simpson,"Okay, we've got cocktail wienies and Swedish meatballs."
Sideshow Bob,"Selma, this wedding is spinning out of control. Can we really afford it? I've already run through eight of the ten dollars they gave me when I left prison."
Selma Bouvier,"Hey relax, I told ya I got money. I bought stock in a mace company just before society crumbled."
Sideshow Bob,"Selma, that's wonderful. I just hope people don't think I'm marrying you for your money, instead of your... less tangible qualities."
,
Sideshow Bob,Tomorrow we'll be Mr. and Mrs. Bob Terwilliger. Isn't it grand?
Selma Bouvier,"Hey, Bob. Give some of that honey this way."
Selma Bouvier,"Holy frijoles! We've got ten minutes till MacGyver! Driver, here's a fin. Get me home and don't spare the whip."
Barney Gumble,"Whatever you say, mum."
,
Selma Bouvier,What did I miss?
Patty Bouvier,MacGyver was wearing a tank top.
Selma Bouvier,Dang.
Sideshow Bob,"Why Selma, I thought I was the only man in your life."
Selma Bouvier,Sit down and shut up.
Man,"Thank you, SeÃ±or MacGyver. You saved our village."
MacGyver,Don't thank me. Thank the moon's gravitational pull.
Selma Bouvier,That MacGyver's a genius.
Marge Simpson,"Ah, that's sweet."
Sideshow Bob,"First of all he's not a genius, he's an actor. And second, he's not much of an actor."
Selma Bouvier,You're lying! You're lying!
Sideshow Bob,"No Selma, this is lying: that was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap that never made me want to retch."
,
Selma Bouvier,"He was so cruel... The things he said, they're just not true."
Marge Simpson,"There, there..."
Bart Simpson,"Oh well, I guess the wedding's off. Fiddle dee dee, tomorrow's another day."
Marge Simpson,Bart! Stop that.
Selma Bouvier,"No, he's right. We're a package. Love me, love MacGyver. I guess the wedding's off."
Sideshow Bob,"Selma, I don't know what to say."
Selma Bouvier,Just tell me you like MacGyver.
Sideshow Bob,Very well. I... I... I can't do it! Even that car chase seemed tacked on.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it's no big deal. You know why?"
Homer Simpson,"Whenever Marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk. I go to a bar, I down a few, and I stumble home in the mood for love."
Sideshow Bob,"Very well, Selma, whenever you watch MacGyver, I'll take a vigorous constitutional and return more in love with you than ever."
Selma Bouvier,Oh Bob.
Bart Simpson,Bart no like. Bad medicine.
,
Lisa Simpson,I could've been the flower girl. And I wouldn't keep falling down either.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, they chose Maggie, okay?"
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, well if they want to go for cutesiness instead of competence, fine."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Do you Bob, take Selma, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, 'til death do you part?"
Sideshow Bob,I do.
,
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Wiener Boy... Where do you think you're going?"
Patty Bouvier,I'm the only single girl left in the family.
Patty Bouvier,"Well, I guess it could be worse."
Seymour Skinner,SHUDDUP!
Marge Simpson,"Oooh, there's Krusty the Clown! Krusty, Krusty, say something funny."
,
Sideshow Bob,"Dear friends, forty one years ago, God took one hundred and sixty-eight pounds of clay and he made me a woman. And for this, I thank Him."
Selma Bouvier,"I just wanted to say, on the advice of my new husband, I've decided to give up smoking."
Selma Bouvier,... Except for after meals and after MacGyver.
Sideshow Bob,"Why Selma dear, you'll bury us all."
Bart Simpson,"Chief Wiggum, you've been around. You don't trust Sideshow Bob, do you?"
Chief Wiggum,"Ahh, lighten up, son. If he was going to commit a crime, would he have invited the No. 1 cop in town? Now, where did I put my gun? Oh, yeah. I set it down when I got a piece of cake..."
Patty Bouvier,I don't know what to say.
Selma Bouvier,Just tell me what you know I want to hear.
Patty Bouvier,I'm dying of jealousy.
Selma Bouvier,Thank you.
,
Sideshow Bob,"That's right dear, enjoy your rest. The wedding was very tough on you, and the honeymoon is going to be... murder."
,
Selma Bouvier,Welcome to our video honeymoon. We're using the video camera Cousin Dot gave us and the video cassette Homer gave us.
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it."
Selma Bouvier,There's Shelbyville Falls... Rolling Rock... And here's another breathtaking sight -- my brand new hubby.
Sideshow Bob,I wanted a room with a fireplace you brainless luggage monkey! Like the one in your brochure!
Sideshow Bob,"Oh, Selma dear, I was just chatting with my good friend, Dennis. Now, smile for the camera. That's a good lad."
Sideshow Bob,"Ah, fire: scourge of Prometheus, toaster of marshmallows, eradicator of deadwood... Oh Selma dear, you and your little camera. What do you say we shut it off for a while?"
Selma Bouvier,And make love?
Bart Simpson,Why would Sideshow Bob go so nuts over a fireplace?
Marge Simpson,Because he wants his honeymoon to be romantic.
Bart Simpson,Romantic? With Aunt Selma?
Marge Simpson,I guess you're just too young to understand.
,
Selma Bouvier,One of my fillings fell out.
Sideshow Bob,Even murder has its ugly side.
Selma Bouvier,"Bob, would you mind rubbing my feet?"
Sideshow Bob,"Darling, you make it sound like a chore."
Selma Bouvier,"Hmm, uh, good..."
Sideshow Bob,Soon I will kill you.
Selma Bouvier,Huh?
Sideshow Bob,"""Son pied sentis beau"". French, for ""Her foot smells lovely""."
Selma Bouvier,Ohhh.
Sideshow Bob,Prepare to be murdered.
Selma Bouvier,Huh?
Sideshow Bob,Be pah de be mudu. That's Sanskrit for your toes are like perfume. Voy a matar a usted.
Selma Bouvier,Whaa?
Sideshow Bob,"That's Spanish for, I'm going to kill you."
Selma Bouvier,Say what?
Sideshow Bob,"Why dear, I do believe it's time for your beloved MacGyver."
Selma Bouvier,"Oh, hey, you're right."
,
Sideshow Bob,"Well, time for my walk."
Selma Bouvier,
Sideshow Bob,Don't forget to die.
,
Patty Bouvier,Ding dong. I was feeling kind of lonely without Selma. Mind if I watch TV with you?
Marge Simpson,"Go ahead, Patty."
Announcer,Tonight on MacGyver...
Bart Simpson,Aunt Selma has one hour to live!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, down in front."
,
Sideshow Bob,Good bye.
Sideshow Bob,Front desk? There's been a terrible accident in my room.
Sideshow Bob,"Poor Selma, you were having such a lovely evening AND THEN I WENT AND SPOILED IT ALL BY DOING SOMETHING STUPID LIKE EXPLODE YOU."
Bart Simpson,"Sideshow Bob, I'm afraid the only victims here are the good people at Best Western Hotels."
Sideshow Bob,Bart!
Sideshow Bob,Selma!
Sideshow Bob,Ughhh.
Selma Bouvier,You tried to kill me. I want a separation.
Sideshow Bob,My best laid plans have gang aglay!
Bart Simpson,"Chief Wiggum, think you have room in your jail for a two-time loser?"
Chief Wiggum,"Well no, frankly, but that never stopped us before."
Sideshow Bob,"Bart, I must know. How did you untangle my web?"
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, Bart. Fill us in."
Bart Simpson,"Well, I'd hate to tell the number one cop in town how to do his job."
Chief Wiggum,"No, no, please. It's the only way I'll learn."
Bart Simpson,All right. Sideshow Bob seemed so desperate to get that fireplace. But why? Then it hit me -- the gas.
Bart Simpson,Surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak -- except Aunt Selma.
Selma Bouvier,I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell.
Bart Simpson,"She happily watched her MacGyver, unaware that her room was silently filling with natural gas. All it needed to explode was a single spark... say, from a cigarette..."
Selma Bouvier,"I decided to give up smoking... except for after meals, and after MacGyver."
,
Bart Simpson,Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, when Aunt Selma lights up her cigarette at the end of MacGyver, she'll be blown to kingdom come!"
Homer Simpson,Come again?
Bart Simpson,"After trying four times to explain it to Homer, I explained it to Mom and we were on our way."
Homer Simpson,To the Simpson mobile!
,
Bart Simpson,Noooo!
Sideshow Bob,"But wait! If you saved Selma, why did the room explode?"
Chief Wiggum,I'll field that one. Me and the boys were all celebrating a job well done when I threw my match in the vicinity of the crime scene.
,
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, right, the gas."
Sideshow Bob,"I'll be back! You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever! And when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies!"
Selma Bouvier,I feel like such a fool.
Marge Simpson,"Well, he fooled almost everyone. But there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust."
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Mom. Now. Let's get out of this gas-filled hallway before we all suffocate."
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey Homer, let's book! I want to get there in time to whip eggs at the warm-up act."
Homer Simpson,"Wow, my concert going jacket still fits. And this is where I used to hide my beer."
Homer Simpson,Billy Beer!
Marge Simpson,My little guy's first rock concert. I hope the Spinal Taps don't play too loud.
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, I went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me."
Marge Simpson,"Hmmm, well, all right, but make sure they don't pick up any of the band's attitudes towards women... liquor... religion... politics... really anything."
Homer Simpson,I hear ya. Come on boy.
Selma Bouvier,There goes Davy Crocket in his bald skin cap.
Marge Simpson,
,
Bill,"In other Spinal Tap news, Mayor Quimby honored the aging super group in a ceremony at City Hall."
Marty,"I guess you could say he was trying to tap into the spines of the young voters, huh?"
Bill,... Yeah... Let's play the tape.
Bart Simpson,"Hey Milhouse, cool jacket!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"It cost me 50,000 Bazooka Joe Comics."
,
Homer Simpson,"Now, just meet me back here after the show."
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Dad. Sure you're not gonna be bored?"
Homer Simpson,"Boy, some of the best times I've ever had were in the back seat of a car."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Baby!"
T-shirt Guy,"Official ""Tour '92"" T-shirts, thirty-one dollars."
Promoter,"Uh, yeah, I don't wanna lie to you boys. Six days a week, the place is a hockey rink."
Comic Book Guy,"Check it out. Spinal Tap kicking Mo-mar Kadaffy in the butt. The timeless classic, now two for a dollar."
,
Marty,"Hey hey hey, Bill and Marty here."
Bill,And we're backstage rappin' with the Tap.
Marty,"Fellows, I'm gonna hit you with a phrase that has dogged you throughout your career: washed-up."
Bill,Yet here you are among the top one hundred and five concert acts today. What's your secret guys?
David,"Well, after the Berlin Wall fell, our records started selling on the dismal side of the Iron Curtain, and naturally that gave us a boost."
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"We're very big in Bulgaria, and wassisname, the other garia."
David,Hungaria.
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"Yeah, whoever."
DEREK,I can't think of anyone who's benefited more from the death of Communism than us.
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"Oh, maybe the people who actually live in the Communist countries."
DEREK,"Oh yeah, hadn't thought of that. I bet you're right."
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"Yeah, on the other hand, each of us just bought out own soccer team. How many Hungarias can say that, eh?"
Roadie,Test... test...
Bart Simpson,"Gee, I'm sorry, man."
Stoned Guy,Huh?
Bart Simpson,About the frisbee.
Stoned Guy,Frisbee?
Bill,"Say guys, I wonder if you'd mind recording a couple of promos for us."
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"Well, like what?"
Marty,"Maybe you could say, ""Nobody rocks like Bill and Marty on KBBL."""
David,"Well, we don't know that, do we?"
Nigel Bakerbutcher,What if somebody rocks as good as you?
DEREK,"Or better. I mean, we don't want to look stupid."
Bill,"Okay, we can respect that."
Marty,"How about ""Rock-a-doodle-do, you're listening to Bill and Marty."""
David,"Yeah, sure."
Nigel Bakerbutcher,That's good... yeah.
,
Crowd,Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap!
David,"I just looked out, and there's puddles of water all over the freakin' stage!"
Bart Simpson,I said slag off!
David,"Yeah, well this is a rock concert, not the bleedin' ...Splish Splash show!"
,
Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Duff Beer, in association with Laramie Cigarettes, is proud to welcome... SPINAL TAP!"
David,WE ARE THE CHILDREN WHO GREW TOO FAST...
DAVID/NIGEL,WE ARE THE DUST OF THE FUTURE PAST...
DAVID/NIGEL/DEREK,WE RAISE OUR VOICES IN THE NIGHT/ CRYING TO HEAVEN...
David,AND WILL OUR VOICES BE HEARD/ OR WILL THEY BREAK LIKE THE WIND!
David,Medium setting!
,
,
Nigel Bakerbutcher,Thank you!
David,All riiiight! This morning we were driving down... Route 401...
Bart Simpson,That's only four miles from my house!
Nigel Bakerbutcher,And we thought they knew how to rock in Shelbyville...
DEREK,But nobody rocks like...Springfield!
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"Well, it seems some silly twit did not get a big enough oxygen pump, but that's supposed to be a devil."
David,"Filled up with air, it's very evil and impressive."
DEREK,"We salute you, our half-inflated Dark Lord."
DEREK,"Y'know, people think there are only five members of Spinal Tap, but they're wrong."
David,"Could we turn up the house lights please? That was the cue to turn up the house lights, so we can tell the audience they're the sixth member of the freakin' group."
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"We are trying to put a tiny thrill into their gray little lives. Oh, forget it, turn on the lasers."
Nigel Bakerbutcher,Aagh! My vision!
Nigel Bakerbutcher,That's it. Show's over.
David,"Goodnight, Springton. There will be no encores."
Milhouse Van Houten,They were only on for twenty minutes!
Bart Simpson,What a gyp!
Otto Mann,"Gnarly show, man."
Snake Jailbird,Wanna trash the stage?
Otto Mann,Okay.
,
Bart Simpson,Cool.
,
Bart Simpson,Knock it off.
Homer Simpson,THERE WAS A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA... A RECORD STAR HE THOUGHT HE'D BE... HE HEARD OF SINGERS LIKE BEATLES... THE CHIPMUNKS HE'D SEEN ON TV... WHY NOT A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA? AND SO HE HID... INSIDE A DOG...
,
,
Kent Brockman,"Tonight a city weeps as, for the first time ever, a hockey arena becomes a scene of violence --following a concert by Spinal Tap."
Marge Simpson,"Hmmm, I hope my poor little baby's okay."
Lisa Simpson,See for yourself.
Marge Simpson,
Kent Brockman,"Of course, it would be wrong to suggest that this sort of mayhem began with rock and roll. After all, there were riots at the premiere of Mozart's ""The Magic Flute"". So what's the answer? Ban all music? In this reporter's opinion the answer, sadly, is yes."
Bart Simpson,"Hi, Mom."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, oh... thank God!"
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I want to be a rock star."
Marge Simpson,We'll discuss it later. Is Milhouse okay?
Homer Simpson,I'll be right back.
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Help! Help!
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I've been thinking about what Bart said. If he's really interested in being a musician, maybe we should BUY him A GUITAR."
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's a waste of money. We already have a guitar."
Marge Simpson,I meant a real guitar.
Homer Simpson,This is real.
Bart Simpson,Wow!
Marge Simpson,And it came with a free instruction book.
Homer Simpson,"Now boy, we spent a lot of money. So you better get real good real fast or pow!"
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I thought I was supposed to encourage him."
Bart Simpson,"I'd like to play me latest chart-topper. It's called ""Me Fans Are Stupid Pigs."""
,
Bart Simpson,
Manager,"Bart, you've got to go on."
Bart Simpson,Slag off!
Milhouse Van Houten,"You've changed, man. You used to be about the music."
Lisa Simpson,I'se just jammin' with you.
,
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, Simpson, what are you trying to play?"
Bart Simpson,Polly Wolly Doodle.
Nelson Muntz,"Oh yeah, well it sounds Polly Wolly Crappy. Haw haw! Burn."
Otto Mann,"Hey, cherry axe, Bart-dude."
Bart Simpson,I think it's broken.
Otto Mann,"Oh, really? Give it here."
Bart Simpson,"I didn't know you played the guitar, Otto-man!"
Otto Mann,"Hey, that's all I did in high school. My old man said I was wasting my time and I'd never amount to anything."
Otto Mann,Now I'd like to slow things down a little bit...
Otto Mann,IF I LEAVE HERE TOMORROW... WOULD YOU STILL REMEMBER ME?
,
Otto Mann,...CANNOT CHAEAEAEANGE... WAOWAOWAOWAOW...
Martin Prince,"Although I'm sure I will receive a severe wedgie from my bus mates, I must remind you we should have been at school ten minutes ago."
Martin Prince,Whoooa!
Otto Mann,"Uh oh. Better fasten your seatbelts, little dudes."
Lisa Simpson,We don't have seatbelts.
Otto Mann,"Huh... well then, just try to go limp."
Otto Mann,Better take a shortcut.
,
,
,
David,Good show last night.
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"Yeah, quite good."
,
,
Chief Wiggum,Good Lord! Did anyone get the license number?
,
,
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, it's a miracle no one was hurt."
Otto Mann,I stand on my record. Fifteen crashes and not a single fatality.
Lou,"Let's see your license, pal."
Otto Mann,"No can do. Never got one. But if you need proof of my identity, I wrote my name on my underwear."
Otto Mann,"Oh, wait, these aren't mine."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Well, that tears it. Until you get a license and wear your own underwear, mister, you are suspended without pay."
Otto Mann,Who's gonna drive the bus?
Seymour Skinner,I drove an all-terrain vehicle in Da Nang. I think I can handle it.
,
Bart Simpson,Where's Otto?
Seymour Skinner,Otto. That's one palindrome you won't be hearing for awhile.
Bart Simpson,
Seymour Skinner,Off we go!
Kids,"HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER / HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER MAN."
Seymour Skinner,"HE DRINKS AND HE CUSSES / HE STINKS UP THE BUSSES/HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER MAN! HA HA!"
Seymour Skinner,Dum de dum... There's an opening. Too late!... Nope... Nope... That'd be cutting it a little close.
Lisa Simpson,"I think you have to be more aggressive, sir."
Seymour Skinner,Nonsense. One of our good citizens will slow down and wave me in.
,
Patty Bouvier,
Selma Bouvier,What's so funny?
Patty Bouvier,I was just thinking about the time Homer got his nose caught in the toaster.
Selma Bouvier,"We'll watch the tape tonight. Oh look, you've got someone at your window."
Otto Mann,Dododo do do do.
Patty Bouvier,"My name's Patty. I'll be testing you. When you do good, I use the green pen. When you do bad, I use the red pen. Any questions?"
Otto Mann,"Yeah, one. Have you always been a chick? I mean, I don't want to offend you but you were born a man, weren't you? You can tell me, I'm open-minded."
Patty Bouvier,I won't be needing this.
,
Otto Mann,"All right! Yeah!... So, how'd I do?"
Patty Bouvier,"Well, you failed every segment and misspelled ""bus"" on your application."
Otto Mann,Drag.
,
Seymour Skinner,Let me in! Let me in!
Ralph Wiggum,"HE STEPS ON THE CLUTCH, AND THE TOILET GOES FLUSH / HAIL TO THE--"
Otto Mann,"Hey Landlord, some clown changed my locks, padlocked the door and put up an eviction notice."
Landlord,"Yeah, that was me."
Otto Mann,You! But... but why?
Landlord,Because you haven't paid your rent.
Otto Mann,"Well, can I at least get my stuff?"
Landlord,All I found in there was a jar of mustard and a couple of old cycle magazines.
Otto Mann,"Wow, I had mustard?"
,
Bart Simpson,"Rough day, Apu. Pump me a Squishee and don't spare the syrup."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Perhaps you'd like to try an experimental flavor of my own concoction. A delicious Chutney-Squishee.
Bart Simpson,Uh... okay.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,You can really taste the chutney.
Bart Simpson,Uggh...
Otto Mann,Ow!
Bart Simpson,Otto-man?
Bart Simpson,You're living in a dumpster?
Otto Mann,"Oh, man, I wish. ""Dumpster"" brand trash bins are top of the line. This is just a ""Trash-Co"" waste disposal unit."
Bart Simpson,"Otto, why don't you come home with me? You can stay in our garage."
Otto Mann,"A garage?! Oh, somebody up there likes me."
Otto Mann,
,
,
Otto Mann,"I FEEL LIKE ROCKIN' SO I THINK I WILL / I'LL ROCK IT, ROCK IT, ROCK IT 'TIL I GET MY FILL... YEAH!"
Otto Mann,Ooh! Hey.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, what's going on?"
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I thought you might forget our little conversation this afternoon, so I took the precaution of recording it."
Marge Simpson,What conversation?
Bart Simpson,"Mom, can Otto live in our garage for as long as he wants? He sure can!"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, what were you thinking?"
Marge Simpson,That's not my voice!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape."
,
Marge Simpson,I don't understand this. Why can't you stay with your parents?
Otto Mann,The admiral and I don't get along. Please let me stay here. I've got nowhere else to go.
Homer Simpson,Forget it. That line didn't work for my dad and it's not gonna work for you.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, Otto's going through a real tough time. Can't he stay with us for awhile?"
Marge Simpson,"I know we didn't ask for this, Homer, but doesn't the Bible say, ""Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me...?"""
Homer Simpson,"Yes, but doesn't the Bible also say, ""Thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut""?"
Bart Simpson,"Please, Dad. If you let Otto stay, he'll help around the house, and chip in a few bucks whenever he can."
Homer Simpson,All right. He can stay. But I get to treat him like garbage.
Otto Mann,"Wow, what's the catch?"
,
Tv Host,A can of corn costs... fifty-seven cents!
Otto Mann,I could sure go for a can of corn.
Marge Simpson,"Otto, you can't just sit there watching TV all day."
Otto Mann,"You know, you're right. I should do a little reading. You got any of those ""Where's Waldo"" books?"
Marge Simpson,No.
Otto Mann,How about anything written from the Vampire's point of view?
Marge Simpson,No.
Otto Mann,"Well, how 'bout anything where guys send in naked pictures of their chicks?"
Marge Simpson,"Otto, I think you should get a job."
Otto Mann,"Look, the only thing I was ever good at was driving a bus and now ""the man"" says I need a piece of paper to do that."
Marge Simpson,So get that piece of paper!
Otto Mann,"I tried -- Oh, Lord, how I did try."
,
Homer Simpson,Will you knock it off! I can't hear myself think.
Homer Simpson,"That's better. Hey, how come you never play your guitar anymore?"
Bart Simpson,"I'll tell you the truth, Dad. I wasn't good at it right away, so I quit. I hope you're not mad."
Bart Simpson,"You can do it, Otto. You're the coolest adult I ever met."
Milhouse Van Houten,Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson,"Son, come here. Heh, heh, heh. Of course I'm not mad. If something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing. You just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we'll go inside and watch TV."
Bart Simpson,What's on?
Homer Simpson,It doesn't matter.
,
Homer Simpson,Open up! Open up! I gotta go and no fooling.
Otto Mann,"Hey, Pop 'N'Fresh. You're supposed to giggle."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,That guy has gotta go.
Marge Simpson,"I know how you feel, but he is good with the kids."
Otto Mann,"... So the lady drove faster, but the strange car kept banging into her from behind."
Lisa Simpson,
Otto Mann,"So finally she swerves off the road into the woods and lost the other car. And that's when she realized the man in the other car wasn't trying to hurt her. No, he was trying to warn her... about the ax-wielding maniac hiding in her back seat!"
Lisa Simpson,Did the maniac kill her?
Otto Mann,Natch! And you know how I know?
Lisa Simpson,How?
Otto Mann,Because... I was that maniac!
Otto Mann,"Hey, hey, I was just kidding."
Homer Simpson,That's it. He's outta here.
Marge Simpson,"But Homer, we're the only family he's got..."
Homer Simpson,"I don't care. This is not ""Happy Days"" and he is not the Fonz."
Otto Mann,"Heyyy, Mr. S..."
Homer Simpson,"Listen you drain clogging, last cookie-eating, collect call-getting sponge, I want you out of my house!"
Otto Mann,Heavy.
Bart Simpson,"What are you going to do, Otto?"
Otto Mann,"Oh, don't worry. There's plenty of money out there for a guy who knows how to fake his own death."
Marge Simpson,"Well, before you do that, maybe you should take the driving test again."
,
Otto Mann,Wow! I've never been called an adult before. I've been tried as one but... I'll do it!
,
Otto Mann,"""Alcohol increases your ability to drive."" False? Oh, man."
,
Otto Mann,"I don't know about this Bart dude. Your dad is right, I am a bum."
Bart Simpson,"He didn't call you a bum, he called you a sponge."
Otto Mann,Sponge?!
Otto Mann,Does this look like something a sponge would do I'll show him who's a sponge.
Patty Bouvier,"Well, if it isn't Wee Willy Washout."
Otto Mann,I want to take the test again.
Patty Bouvier,Why?
Otto Mann,So I can staple my license to Homer Simpson's big bald head.
Patty Bouvier,"Really? Well, here's your written test."
Patty Bouvier,"I'll get you started. B, C, D, A, B."
,
Otto Mann,Homer had a piece of food on his face for three days.
Patty Bouvier,
Otto Mann,It wasn't little either. It was a chicken wing.
Patty Bouvier,Wing.
Otto Mann,What was that?
Patty Bouvier,It doesn't matter. Let's get some Margaritas. I'm buyin'!
,
Bart Simpson,Otto!
Otto Mann,That's what my driver's license says.
Kids,"HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER..."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, hail to the bus driver... Bus Driver Man!"
,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...
Homer Simpson,What the...
Bart Simpson,
,
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, Bart, look at this. My dad took me to Circus of Values last night and said I could get anything I wanted."
Bart Simpson,Cool! An oversized novelty billiard ball.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Yeah, you shake it up and it tells the future."
Bart Simpson,Will I pass my English test?
Bart Simpson,Outlook not so good. Wow! It does work!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Let me try. Will I get beat up today? ""All signs point to yes."""
Nelson Muntz,That ball knows everything.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, I got a good one. Will Milhouse and I be friends till we're toothless old men with hair coming out of our ears? READING BALL, SURPRISED) ""Don't count on it."" Will Milhouse and I be friends when we're high school dropouts living off Uncle Sucker? ""It looks doubtful."" Will Milhouse and I be friends at the end of the day?"
Bart Simpson,What could come between two bestest buddies like us?
,
Seymour Skinner,Samantha I've always been suspicious of transfer students... Other principals try to unload problem cases that way... Lord knows I do.
Samantha Stanky,"I'm a good student, Principal Skinner."
Seymour Skinner,"Yeah sure, and they told me I'd get a big parade when I got back from 'Nam. Instead they spat on me. I can still feel it searing. So, now let's just see what the permanent record has to say, shall we?"
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm... no detention... fairly good attendance record... Oh, I see you beat that bed wetting problem in the second grade."
Samantha Stanky,That's in there?
Seymour Skinner,"Don't worry. They'll forget. Just like they forgot about me in that tiger cage for eighteen agonizing months. Every night I'd wake up screaming. Well, let's meet your classmates."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey Bart, was this thing right about your test?"
Bart Simpson,"To those who doubt the power of the Magic 8-Ball, I say ""Behold my ""F!"""
Seymour Skinner,"Attention class, I have a new student for you."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Great, another student. Just keep packing 'em in, Seymour."
Seymour Skinner,"I think we should discuss this later, Edna. Now, it's never easy to come to a new school, so let's make her feel right at home. Please say a big elementary school hello to Samantha Stinky."
Samantha Stanky,Stanky.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, right. How embarrassing for you. Well, goodbye."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"I'm sure this is a little scary for you, dear."
Samantha Stanky,Uh-huh.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,So why don't you stand up in front of the class and tell us about yourself? I'll be grading you on grammar and poise.
Samantha Stanky,"We just moved here from Phoenix. My Dad owns a home security company. He came to Springfield because of its high crime rate and lackluster police force. All my friends are back in Phoenix, and this town has a weird smell that you're all probably used to -- but I'm not."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"It'll take you about six weeks, dear."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Milhouse, would you like a wet willie?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Sure.
Milhouse Van Houten,Eew!
Bart Simpson,"Victim number four. Hey, Lewis, can I interest you in a wet willie?"
Lewis Clark,Sure!
Milhouse Van Houten,
Milhouse Van Houten,When I find out who hit me with that ball... I'm gonna tear 'em a new...
Milhouse Van Houten,Wuh.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Class, in order to explain why your hormones will soon make you an easy target for every smooth talking Lothario with his own car and tight jeans, I will now show a short sex education film."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Ezekiel and Ismail, in accordance with your parents' wishes, you may step out into the hall and pray for our souls."
,
Bart Simpson,Bo-ring!
Kids,Eew!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,She's faking it.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Any questions?
Nelson Muntz,"Mrs. Krabappel, how come you don't live with Mr. Krabappel?"
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Because Mr. Krabappel chased something small and fluffy down a rabbit hole.
Samantha Stanky,How do we know when we fall in love?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Oh, don't you worry. Most of you will never fall in love and marry out of fear of dying alone."
Bart Simpson,"How would I go about creating a half-man, half-monkey type creature?"
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"I'm sorry, that would be playing God."
Bart Simpson,"God shmod, I want my monkey-man."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Ah, that's a nice dress."
Samantha Stanky,My dad makes me wear it. I hate it.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, I hate it too. Uh -- can I walk you home?"
Samantha Stanky,Okay.
,
Otto Mann,"Everybody on, but no shoving. Just kiddin', you can shove all you want."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, wait Otto-man, you can't leave. Milhouse isn't here yet."
Otto Mann,"Sorry Bart-dude, no time. My girlfriend's dancing topless at the airport bar from four fifteen to four twenty."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, what a pleasant surprise."
Samantha Stanky,Hi.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, what's with the skirt?"
Milhouse Van Houten,I've brought friends to this treehouse before.
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but never a girl. What if I want to strut around nude?"
Samantha Stanky,Maybe I should go.
Homer Simpson,So long stomach. We've had a lot of great memories.
,
Bart Simpson,"No, that's okay. You can stay. You can read comics with us. Let's see, something for the lady...ah, ""Radioactive Man Vs. the Swamp Hag."
Samantha Stanky,"Got any girl comics? Like ""Bonnie Craine, Girl Attorney,"" ""Punkin & Duncan, the Twinkle Twins,"" or ""L'il Kneesocks?"""
Bart Simpson,"No, but my sister's got a wide selection of crappy comics."
Bart Simpson,you guys wanna see something gross?
Bart Simpson,
Announcer,"Tonight on Smartline -- ""I'm Okay, You're Too Fat"". Here's your host, Kent Brockman."
Kent Brockman,"Good evening. Did you know that thirty-four million American adults are obese? Taken together, that excess blubber could fill the Grand Canyon two-fifths of the way up. That may not sound impressive, but keep in mind it is a very big canyon."
,
Homer Simpson,This sucks. Where is that channel changer?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, eh, I'll give it a chance."
Kent Brockman,"Americans have grown up with the image of the jolly fat man. Dom DeLuise, Alfred Hitchcock, and of course, Santa Claus. But in real life, Santa would be suffering from gallstones, hypertension, impotence, and diabetes."
Marge Simpson,I wish they had never invented fried cheese!
Grave Digger,We've got to widen the hole.
Crane Operator,"Well, make it snappy. The chain's startin' to give!"
Female Announcer,"We take eighteen ounces of sizzling ground beef and soak it in rich creamery butter. Then we top it off with bacon, ham and a fried egg. We call it the ""Good Morning Burger!"""
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,I gotta help him.
,
Samantha Stanky,
Bart Simpson,"Okay, Milhouse... I'll trade your Carl Yastrzemski baseball card for my Omar Vizquel."
Bart Simpson,"Deal! Next on the trading block, your Mickey Mantle -- 1958, mint condition -- for my picture of Homer on the couch."
Samantha Stanky,"Milhouse, I gotta go."
Samantha Stanky,My dad thinks I'm having my braces examined.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, you kinda-sorta are."
,
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, we're living in the age of cooties. I can't believe the risk you're running. Besides, what's so great about kissing?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, it's not just the kissing. A lot of it is waitin' to kiss. You know like when you open an Eskimo Pie and you wait just a little bit for it to melt?"
Bart Simpson,But she doesn't melt.
Milhouse Van Houten,Oh yes she does!
Female Announcer,We start with pure milk chocolate...
Homer Simpson,Chocolate...
Female Announcer,Add a layer of farm-fresh honey...
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, sweet."
Female Announcer,Then we sprinkle on four kinds of sugar...
Female Announcer,And dip it in rich creamery butter.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, what if I told you, you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger?"
Homer Simpson,"I'd say ""You're a lying scumbag."" Why sweetie?"
Lisa Simpson,According to Eternity Magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. That's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it.
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter."
Lisa Simpson,"They'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep. As you hear new-age music, a powerful message goes to your brain, telling you to eat less."
Homer Simpson,"Lose weight and listen to new-age music? Wow! What do you think, Marge?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, I love you just the way you are. Lisa, what's that number?"
,
Marge Simpson,"Operator, I'd like to place an order for my husband."
Operator,"Would he like to lose weight, stop smoking, learn the state capitals, master hostage negotiations..."
Marge Simpson,Hmmm... Hostage negotiations.
Homer Simpson,"Listen, Tabouli, we're ignoring all of your demands. What do you say to that?"
Marge Simpson,Better give me the weight loss tape.
,
Worker #1,"We're out of ""Subliminally Slim."""
Worker #2,"Eh, just send him the vocabulary builder."
Worker #1,"Here you go, fatso."
,
Dr. Marvin Monroe,"Hello, this is Doctor Marvin Monroe ""Let's build your vocabulary"" A: abattoir: slaughterhouse. ""The cow was slaughtered in the abattoir."""
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, has the weight-loss tape reduced your appetite?"
Homer Simpson,"Lamentably, no. My gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety."
Marge Simpson,Don't you usually play with Milhouse after school?
Bart Simpson,He has a girlfriend.
Marge Simpson,Milhouse?
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, all they do is kiss."
,
Bart Simpson,No.
Marge Simpson,How cute.
,
,
Bart Simpson,Hey Martin.
Martin Prince,Bart? This is the first time anyone has ever sat next to me since I successfully lobbied to have the school day extended by twenty minutes.
Bart Simpson,"Listen Martin, right now I'm looking for a friend who won't leave me for a girl."
Martin Prince,That's me. I'm just as unpopular with the ladies as I am with the chaps.
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, right. Anyway... do you want to do something after school?"
Martin Prince,"It's a date. Everyone, Bart and I would like to announce that we are friends!"
,
Martin Prince,"Now Bart, would you care to listen to me play the lute?"
Bart Simpson,"Uh, sure."
Martin Prince,"""COME HOME MY BONNIE WARRIOR, / FOR NOW THE NETS ARE FULL OF FISH --"""
,
Marge Simpson,I don't know if that tape is working. You ate three desserts tonight.
Homer Simpson,Forbearance is the watchword. That triumvirate of Twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.
Marge Simpson,There's another thing I've been wanting to talk to you about...
Homer Simpson,"Tut tut, gentle Marge. For here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary!"
Marge Simpson,What in God's name are you talking about?
Marge Simpson,Oh.

Bart Simpson,"Hey, guys."
Man,"Wow, that really took my mind off those awful transforming space mutants."
Woman,Good.
Man,"Man, I could sure go for a snack."
Woman,Me too.
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't the three of us go spit on the Principal's car?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Listen, Bart... there's such a thing as spendin' too much time together."
Bart Simpson,Oh. Fine. I'm tired of watching you two lip wrestle. There's plenty of other ways to be grossed out in this town.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, wait!"
Bart Simpson,Yeah?
Milhouse Van Houten,Uh... can we still use your tree house?
Bart Simpson,What? Get bent.
Milhouse Van Houten,If her father catches us -- he'll kill her.
Bart Simpson,"All right, Milhouse. You can use my tree house."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Thanks, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Samantha and Milhouse sitting in a tree, about to lose their pri-va-cy!"
,
Homer Simpson,Now there's a Machiavellian countenance.
Homer Simpson,Ooh...a sextet of ale.
Bart Simpson,"Hello, Mr. Stanky... I have some shocking news about your daughter Samantha... Who am I? Let's just say I'm a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands."
,
Samantha Stanky,I bet you had peanut butter for breakfast.
Milhouse Van Houten,Yeah...
Mr. Stanky,Samantha!
Samantha Stanky,Dad!
Mr. Stanky,Nooooooooooo!
Mr. Stanky,"Samantha, you're my little girl and sometimes my imagination runs away with me. Just, just tell me what happened."
Samantha Stanky,"Well, Milhouse and I --"
Mr. Stanky,That's enough! I'm putting you in an all girls school. You're never going to see that boy again.
Samantha Stanky,Milhouse!
Milhouse Van Houten,Samantha!
Bart Simpson,"Well Milhouse, ""'Tis better to have loved and lost""... yada yada yada... let's go to the arcade."
Homer Simpson,Nah.
Milhouse Van Houten,"How could this happen? We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy."

Dr. Marvin Monroe,Haruspicy: Predicting the future through the study of animal entrails.
Lisa Simpson,Dad! Dad! Do you know what today is?
Homer Simpson,The vernal equinox?
Lisa Simpson,No. It's two weeks since you got that subliminal weight loss tape. Let's get you on the scale.
Lisa Simpson,You've gained thirteen pounds.
Homer Simpson,Disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery! A pox on them!
,
Chuck,There stands a broken man.
Ralph Wiggum,It's recess everywhere but in his heart.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey Bart, according to this magazine, in another million years, man will have an extra finger."
Bart Simpson,"Five fingers? Ew, freak show. Listen, Lis. I need some advice and mom's not here."
Lisa Simpson,Why didn't you go to dad?
Bart Simpson,"I did, but I couldn't understand what the hell he was saying. Lisa, I feel terrible. I ratted on my best friend and he doesn't even know I did it."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, according to ""Eternity"" magazine, the feeling of guilt has been linked to the neutrotransmitter gammaphenamine. Dow chemical is developing a minty gel, which will eliminate excess guilt, but unfortunately it won't be on the market for another six months. So I guess you're gonna have to bite the bullet and confess to Milhouse."
,
Luann Van Houten,"Bart, I'm glad you're here. Milhouse could use a friend like you."
Bart Simpson,Yeah.
,
Bart Simpson,Milhouse?
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, I didn't want you to see me cry."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, come on, I've seen you cry a million times. You cry when you scrape your knee. You cry when they're out of chocolate milk. You cry when you're doing long division and you have a remainder left over."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, I didn't want you to see me cry this time."
,
Bart Simpson,"Listen, Milhouse. I've got a confession to make. I'm the one who narked on your kissing."
Milhouse Van Houten,What?!
Luann Van Houten,Milhouse is out of bed and full of beans.
Kirk Van Houten,"Whoa, it's a miracle!"
Bart Simpson,"Boy, I bet the 8-ball didn't see that one comin'."
Milhouse Van Houten,Yeah.
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, where's that... metal dealie... you use to... dig... food."
Marge Simpson,You mean a spoon?
Homer Simpson,Yuh. Yuh. Yuh.
Homer Simpson,Yeah that's good.
,
Bart Simpson,Are you sure you want to do this?
Milhouse Van Houten,I can't stop thinking about her. Even these gates remind me of her braces.
Bart Simpson,How are we going to find her?
Milhouse Van Houten,She said she'd be wearing a plaid jumper.
Samantha Stanky,Milhouse!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Samantha, I went to Circus of Values to buy you a ten gallon tub of Gummy Bears."
Bart Simpson,"Hey Samantha, I'm sorry about gettin' you thrown in the penguin house."
Samantha Stanky,"That's all right, Bart. I love Saint Sebastian's. It's run by a group of French Canadian nuns. They're very nice, except they never let me out."
Nun,"Dominique - nique - nique, etc."
NUN #2,"Samantha, ne pas de boys!"
Samantha Stanky,"I have to go now, Milhouse."
Samantha Stanky,I'd better not. It's fifty rosaries a kiss.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, okay."
Samantha Stanky,"Oh, what the heck."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, think I can ever find another one like her?"
Bart Simpson,"You're asking the wrong guy, Milhouse. They all look alike to me. Now let's go whip donuts at old people"

Homer Simpson,"Forgot there was a physical today, huh?"
Lenny Leonard,"Yeah. Hey, Homer, can I borrow your underwear?"
Doctor,This can't be right. This man has 104% body fat!
Doctor,"Hey, no eating in the tank!"
Homer Simpson,Go to hell.

Marge Simpson,"How was your day at work, dear?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, the usual. Stand in front of this, open that, pull down this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way, cough..."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, I'm afraid Homer Simpson is sterile."
C. Montgomery Burns,Who?
Waylon Smithers,One of your cabbage heads from Sector 7-G. Take a look at this sperm sample from his recent physical.
C. Montgomery Burns,Ewww.
Waylon Smithers,"Now, compare this with a normal sperm sample."
C. Montgomery Burns,Hm. Oh yes.
Waylon Smithers,I'm afraid radiation from the plant is the reason he's shooting blanks. He could sue us for millions.
C. Montgomery Burns,Mother of pearl. Call my lawyers!
,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Before you begin, let me make one thing clear to you. I want your legal advice. I even pay for it. But to me you're all vipers. You live on personal injury. You live on divorces. You live on pain and misery...... but I'm rambling. Anybody want any coffee?"
Lawyer,I'll have some coffee.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Want it black, don't you? Black like your heart! It's so hard for me to listen to you, I hate you all so much... I'm sorry. It's my problem. I'll deal with it. Please continue."
Lawyer,"If you offer Mr. Simpson a token sum -- say, a couple thou -- he'll be so dazzled, he'll sign anything you shove under his nose."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, brilliant. A cash settlement. I could have figured that out, you button-down maggot."
Lawyer,Do you have any cream?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh yes, of course. Where are my manners?"
,
Bum,"Yeah... I used to be rich. I owned ""Mickey Mouse Massage Parlors"". Then those Disney sleezeballs shut me down. I said, ""Look, I'll change the logo, put Mickey's pants back on"". Some guys you just can't reason with."
HERB,"Well, I used to own a successful car company. My strategy was givin' them Japanese names. You guys ever drive a Tempura Hatchback?"
HERB,"Yeah, life was sweet. Then I found out I had a long lost half- brother."
,
HERB,Homer!
Homer Simpson,Herb?
HERB,I let him design a car that would make or break my company.
,
Female Announcer,Presenting... The Homer!
HERB,I'm ruined!
HERB,"Forbes Magazine called it the ""Blunder of the Century."" A little overblown, don't you think? What about new Coke?"
WILLIAM POWEL LOOKALIKE,"Hey, I invented that."
HERB,"Yeah, but all that's in the past. Because this is America and in America you're never finished as long as you've got a brain in your head. Because all a man really needs is an idea."
Bum,"Well, I'm lit."
Bum #2,Me too.
,
Bart Simpson,"And now, the next event...in our Living Room Olympics... the always controversial, couch vault. I do this for Stain Master Carpets. Proud sponsor of the Living Room Olympics."
Homer Simpson,What the hell are you two...
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my couch! The arms, the seat... the dream is over. All right, who did this?"
Bart Simpson,"We were just sitting on the couch, quietly chatting, when we heard a creaking noise."
Lisa Simpson,We leapt off just in time to see it collapse.
Bart Simpson,"There, there. You're safe now, little sister."
Homer Simpson,"Well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when TV's brightest stars come out to shine!?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, goodbye, old girl. We've had a lot of great memories."

Homer Simpson,"Well friend, you're going back where you came from. The curb in front of Flanders' house."
,
HERB,"Let's see, I need an idea... idea... idea... What's the matter with me? I used to have hundreds of ideas."
Mother,What do you want? I just changed your diaper. Are you hungry? Are you cold? Do you want to go home?
HERB,"Lady, you just gave me the idea of a lifetime. How do I thank you?"
Mother,Please don't hurt me.
HERB,Consider it done.
,
Lenny Leonard,"Hey pal, I heard about the couch."
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, you gonna to be okay?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. You know, my life just can't get any worse."
Homer Simpson,That's right. There's no way my life could possibly get any worse.
Waylon Smithers,Simpson! Report to Mr. Burns' office at once!
Homer Simpson,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Is this the one with the lazy sperm?
Waylon Smithers,Hmmm hmmm.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Simpson, you big virile son-of-a- gun. How would you like a check for two-thousand dollars?"
Homer Simpson,Would I!
C. Montgomery Burns,All you have to do is sign this form.
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. I'm not signing anything until I read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, well, it just explains that you've won -- yes, that's it -- won the first annual... uh... Montgomery Burns... uh... Award for... a-a-a Outstanding Achievement in...a-a th... th.. the field of... uh, Excellence!"
Homer Simpson,Don't I get some kind of trophy? At a big award ceremony?

Men Singers,OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT IN -
Female Singers,THE FIELD OF --
Singers,"EXCELLENCE!"""
Homer Simpson,Herb!
C. Montgomery Burns,Yess... that was Bonita De Wolf and the Springfield Nuclear Plant Soft Shoe Society.
Lisa Simpson,This Award is the biggest farce I ever saw.
Bart Simpson,What about the Emmys?
Lisa Simpson,I stand corrected.
C. Montgomery Burns,"And now to present the award, here's former heavyweight champion, Smokin' Joe Frazier."
,
Smokin' Joe Frazier,"Webster's Dictionary defines excellence as ""the quality or condition of being excellent"". And now, the winner of the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award For Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence."
Homer Simpson,Please please please please please...
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you know you won."
Homer Simpson,Don't jinx it!
Smokin' Joe Frazier,The winner... Homer Simpson!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my God!! Woo hoo! I win!"
,
Smokin' Joe Frazier,"Keep those pickled eggs comin', Moe."
Moe Szyslak,You cleaned me out Smokin' Joe. What's the matter Homer? Cummerbund too tight?
Homer Simpson,I miss my couch.
Smokin' Joe Frazier,I know how you feel. You lost a couch. I lost a heavyweight championship.
Homer Simpson,Pfft! Heavyweight championship. There's like three of those. That couch was one of a kind.
Smokin' Joe Frazier,"Homer, I know things are tough now. But one day you'll be walking along and you'll see a piece of furniture that you can love just as much."
Barney Gumble,"Hey, Frazier, shut up!"
Smokin' Joe Frazier,"Barney, you've been riding my back all night."
Barney Gumble,Oh yeah? Care to step outside?
Smokin' Joe Frazier,Let's do it.
Homer Simpson,I think I'm gonna take a walk.
,
Barney Gumble,All right! A peanut!

HERB,"I'm telling you, all a man needs is an idea. And I've got an idea."
Bum #2,Then how come you're still a bum?
HERB,"All right. A man needs two things, an idea and money to get it off the ground. Hello, what's this?"
HERB,"""Local man, Homer Simpson, receives award and $2,000 check."" Hmmm... Any of you guys know which freight goes to Springfield?"
HERB,Uh-uh. Nope. Nope. That's the one.
,
,
Homer Simpson,"I feel so empty. So alone, so... couchless."
Homer Simpson,Wow. The Spine Melter 2000.
,
Homer Simpson,Give me full power.
Salesman,But sir...
Homer Simpson,"Dammit, I said full power!"
Lisa Simpson,Dad? Dad?
Homer Simpson,I'll take it.
Marge Simpson,"This chair is $2,000. We could buy a whole living room set for that."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, there's an empty spot I've always had inside me. I tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. But those were dead ends. I think this chair is the answer."
Marge Simpson,This money was a blessing. We can't just spend it on some creature comfort.
Homer Simpson,"All right, we won't get the chair. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky."
,
Ned Flanders,Yes?
HERB,"Oh... uh... sorry, I must have the wrong house."
Ned Flanders,"Ho, ho, that's where you're wrong, friend."
Ned Flanders,Aren't we in luck? Today's our tithe day and we've got ourselves a transient. Come in my friend. Let us feed and bathe you.
HERB,Hey wait a minute...
Todd Flanders,"Dad, can I anoint the sores on his feet?"
Ned Flanders,"I think it's Mom's turn, son."
Todd Flanders,"Ah, no fair."
,
HERB,Thanks for the suit.
Ned Flanders,"Well, if you ever want to spend the night, Maude and I can sleep on card tables."
Todd Flanders,ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS...
Todd Flanders,"""MARCHING AS TO WAR, ETC..."""
,
Homer Simpson,They're singing again. Lousy neighbors. Wish I was deaf.
HERB,"What am I gonna say? This is the guy who ruined me. But on the other hand, he's family. So many conflicting emotions. How to express them..."
Lisa Simpson,Unky Herb!
HERB,Bart... Lisa. I'm so glad to see you.
Homer Simpson,You weren't so glad to see me.
HERB,"I'm sorry, Homer. But I'm still mad at you. Every word you say just makes me want to punch you in the face."
Homer Simpson,"Well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt?"
HERB,"I'll try, but I'm not making any promises."
Marge Simpson,Herb! How have you been?
HERB,"I've been living in a cardboard box, sleeping on grates, eatin' out of dumpsters. You?"
Marge Simpson,Can't complain.
Homer Simpson,"Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode."
Homer Simpson,On... off... on... off.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, he knows how to work a light switch."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. Right. I don't know what this switch does."
,
,
HERB,"This is really great, Marge."
Marge Simpson,I got the recipe from the Utility Grade Beef Counsel.
Homer Simpson,They do good work.
Bart Simpson,"Unky Herb, what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself?"
HERB,Discarded pizza boxes are an inexpensive source of cheese.
HERB,"Lisa, aren't you happy to see me?"
Lisa Simpson,"Why didn't you write, Unky Herb?"
HERB,"Hey if I wrote to you what was I supposed to say? ""Dear Lisa, last night I used a rat for a pillow thanks to your pop."
Lisa Simpson,I see your point.
HERB,WHETHER YOU'RE DRIVING NEAR OR FAR / POWELL MAKES A POW-POW-POWERFUL CAR!
HERB,"Maggie, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. You're gonna make me rich again. Yes-oo are! Yes-oo are!"
HERB,"One, two, three... Ventnor Avenue."
Lisa Simpson,"And while on Ventnor Avenue you'll be staying at the fabulous Hotel Lisa. A valet will be around shortly to park your thimble. Of course, there is the unpleasant matter of the bill."
HERB,Get to the point.
Lisa Simpson,Eleven hundred and fifty bones.
HERB,That's all I got.
Homer Simpson,"Broke again, eh Herb? Just like in real life. I guess you're just not much of a businessman."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Maybe we should play another game.
Bart Simpson,Why are we playin' games when we got two grand in the bank!? Remember when Dad won the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence?
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I think we should invest in a set of the great books of Western Civilization. Look at this ad from ""New Republic for Kids."" Each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: ""Paradise Regained,"" ""Martin Chuzzlewit,"" or Herman Melville's twin classics ""Omoo"" and ""Typee""."
Homer Simpson,"Wait, Marge. Didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair?"
Marge Simpson,That was your idea.
Bart Simpson,"I think we should get a machine gun. We could use it to hunt game, spell out things, or ring in the new year!"
Marge Simpson,"Well, I really think we need to replace the washer and dryer."
HERB,How would you like to spend two thousand dollars to give a broken man a second chance?
Homer Simpson,Nah.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, wait. Herb, what're you talking about?"
HERB,Up-up-up-up. Not here. Come into the dining room. I want to give you a twenty-minute presentation that will change the world.
Homer Simpson,Twenty minutes?!
HERB,"Okay. Now, before I tell you about my idea, I'd like to show you this."
Homer Simpson,It's drinking the water!
HERB,"Take it easy, Homer. Now this is an example of how one little idea -- carefully marketed..."
Homer Simpson,This is the greatest invention in the world! You'll make a million dollars!
HERB,"No, Homer. That invention is out already. I'm just using it as an example."
Homer Simpson,It's going back for more!
Homer Simpson,
HERB,"Homer, this is my invention."
HERB,"Now, of course, with these blueprints you'll have to use your imagination."
Lisa Simpson,Maggie! Maggie!
HERB,"It's a baby translator. It measures the pitch, the frequency, and the urgency of a baby's cries. Then it tells whoever's around -- in plain English -- exactly what the baby is trying to say. Everything from ""Change me"" to ""turn off that damn Raffi record."""
Marge Simpson,That's a very clever idea!
HERB,All I need is a couple thousand dollars to build a prototype. You'll have your money back in thirty days. I swear.
Lisa Simpson,I think we owe a debt to Unky Herb. He took us into his home and Dad destroyed him.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, you know some shyster's gonna bilk you out of your money. It may as well be your brother."
Homer Simpson,"All right, Herb, I'll lend you the two thousand bucks. But you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother."
HERB,Nope.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, then just give me the drinking bird."
HERB,"Now, let's see... What could you be trying to say? Nothing downstairs... You just took a nap..."
HERB,I want to suck your nose.
HERB,Ooga booga! Ooga booga!
HERB,I'm scared.
HERB,"Hmm... the amplitude of the sine wave is insufficient for ""Burp Me"", and this saw-tooth formation is something I've never..."
HERB,Eureka.
HERB,"Now, I bet you're all wondering what lies under this sheet."
Bart Simpson,Not really. We peeked inside while you were in the john.
HERB,"Oh. Well, here it is again. My ""Baby Translator!"""
Marge Simpson,Whoooa!!
HERB,"Marge, you don't have to humor me."
Marge Simpson,"Well, it's pretty ingrained."
HERB,"What do you think, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,"Herb, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks."
HERB,"Homer, could you stop thinking about your ass!"
Homer Simpson,"I try, but I can't."
Herb Powell,Lavish attention on me and entertain me.
Marge Simpson,"Maggie, you talked!"
HERB,You see! It tells you exactly what's on the baby's mind.
Homer Simpson,Never mind.
Herb Powell,Where did you go?
Lisa Simpson,Peek-a-boo!
Herb Powell,"Oh, there you are. Very amusing."
HERB,"Well, Homer, now what do you think?"
Homer Simpson,"I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, every mother in the country is going to want one of these."
Herb Powell,I have soiled myself. How embarrassing.
Homer Simpson,I gave Herb all the money I had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear.
Marge Simpson,"Don't worry, he can't stay mad at you forever. He is your brother."
Homer Simpson,"Well, when is he gonna act like it?"
,
,
Professor Jonathan Frink,"This radio controlled plane gives your baby the chance to fly, just like my son here. He can execute the barrel roll... loop-de-loop... then bring it in for the perfect landing."
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Whoop, oh dear. My wife is going to kill me."
,
Herb Powell,I only want to eat candy!
Mom,Then that's all you'll get.
Herb Powell,This leash demeans us both.
Woman,I'll take two.
Man,I'll take a dozen!
Man #2,"I represent the ""Precious Baby Discount Stores"". I'll take 50,000."
HERB,I'm rich again! USA! USA! USA!
,
HERB,"Homer, here's a check for two-thousand dollars. But I also wanted to give you each a little something for believing in me. Lisa, this is the first volume of The Great Books of Western Civilization. You'll receive a new one every month. From ""Beowulf"" to ""Less Than Zero."""
Lisa Simpson,"Finally, a copy of ""Ethan Frome"" to call my own."
HERB,"Now Bart, I know you're too young for the machine gun you wanted. But I'm gonna give you something that'll make sure when you're old enough you can still buy one. A membership in the National Rifle Association."
Bart Simpson,"Wow! The NRA. Can I be get armor piercing cyanide-tipped bullets, too?"
HERB,"It's in the Constitution, son."
HERB,"Maggie, who brought me my fortune I'll give you anything you want in this world."
Herb Powell,I want what the dog's eating.
Homer Simpson,
HERB,I'll get you somethin' nice. Now Marge...
Marge Simpson,"Herb, I appreciate your generosity, but I don't need any gift from you."
HERB,"You're too late, Marge. I got you a new washer and dryer. And I sold the old ones for fifty bucks."
,
Barney Gumble,Come on washer!
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, you stupid dryer!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Herb, I don't think there's a vibrating chair in that bag for me."
HERB,"Homer, walk me to my car."
Homer Simpson,"What do I get? What do I get? It's not another punch in the face is it? Because if it is, I don't want it."
HERB,"This is what you get, Homer. I forgive you. You can call me brother and I can do the same."
Homer Simpson,That's it?
HERB,That's it.
Homer Simpson,"I see your point, brother."
HERB,"Gimme a hug, brother."
Homer Simpson,All right... but I never really hugged a man before.
HERB,"Homer, I bought you the damn chair."
HERB,That's enough already. Get outta here!

Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Well, children, it's the last day of school."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Here are your grades.
Bart Simpson,"Oh no, Mrs. Krabappel. If I don't get a C average, my Dad won't let me go to Kamp Krusty."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Well, it isn't fair to the other children, but, all right."

Homer Simpson,Well it is.
Bart Simpson,"Oh how do I know this isn't some beautiful dream, too?"
Bart Simpson,"You know, a pinch is more traditional."
Marge Simpson,"Homie, you do remember your promise to the children?"
Homer Simpson,"Sure do. When you're eighteen, you're out the door."
Lisa Simpson,"No, Dad. You promised if Bart and I got C averages we could go to Kamp Krusty. And with no false modesty, you're looking at one happy camper."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah. Well, just remember when you see my report card they got this whole new grading system this year. It now goes: D,B,A,C."
Homer Simpson,"Now listen, boy. We have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. I don't think I'd be any kind of a father if you got D's and I let you go to Kamp Krusty."
Bart Simpson,But Dad...

Lisa Simpson,"Oh Miss Hoover, there appears to be a mistake on my report card. You gave me a B+ in conduct."
Miss Hoover,"Now Lisa, everyone needs a blotch on their permanent record."

Krusty the Clown,Hi kids! Only one week left to sign up for the bestest summer ever at Kamp Krusty!
Krusty the Clown,"Kamp Krusty is built on an actual Indian burial ground. We've got archery, wallet-making, the whole megillah. And for you fat kids, my exclusive program of diet and ridicule will really get results."
Krusty the Clown,"And the best part is when you come to Kamp Krusty, you'll spend the summer with me. Honest Injun!"
Bart Simpson,"Well, here goes nothin'."
Homer Simpson,Stupid roller-skate.
Bart Simpson,"Well, dad, here's my report card. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
Homer Simpson,"A+? You don't think much of me, do you boy?"
Bart Simpson,"No, sir."
Homer Simpson,You know a D turns into a B so easily. You just got greedy.
Bart Simpson,So I won't get to go to camp?
Homer Simpson,"Now, Bart. We made this deal because I thought it would help you get good grades. And you didn't. But why should you pay for my mistake?"
Bart Simpson,You mean I can go?
Homer Simpson,Yeah. I didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, Dad. You're the best father a boy could ever have!"
Homer Simpson,"Thanks son. Now, you've got little hands. Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?"
Bart Simpson,"Ah sure, there'll be a couple of uptight counselors who won't dig the Bart philosophy, but I feel the human body is a thing of beauty."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, am I crazy, or is my back getting hairier?"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Before I go to camp, I'll need boosters for malaria, German Measles, encephalitis, Hansen's disease..."

Kids,"Burn, Krusty, burn. Burn, Krusty, burn."
Kent Brockman,A group of school-age Spartacuses has taken this camp by force. Three counselors are missing and presumed scared. What's that? I'm being told I can have an exclusive interview with the ring leader.
,
HOMER'S THOUGHT,Don't be the boy. Don't be the boy.
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"I just want the whole world to know that this was a really crappy camp. Can I say ""crappy"" on TV?"
Kent Brockman,"Yes, on this network you can."
,
Kent Brockman,Are you and Princess Di just friends?
Krusty the Clown,You people make me sick. You're vultures. Where were you when I sang at Farm Aid? Out of my way you parasites. I said out of my way.
,
Krusty the Clown,"I'm no fake, I am the real Krusty."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh yeah? Who played your daughter in the short-lived sitcom, ""President Clown""?"
Krusty the Clown,"I don't know her name, but she held up a liquor store last year."
Bart Simpson,I smell bacon. Let's see if he's wearing a wire.
Lisa Simpson,"It is the real Krusty. Look at that pacemaker scar, the cattle skull birthmark, and his famous superfluous nipple."
Krusty the Clown,"Well, at least you're not as bad as customs."
Bart Simpson,"How could you, Krusty? I'd never lend my name to an inferior product."
Krusty the Clown,They drove a dump truck full of money up to my house. I'm not made of stone!
Bart Simpson,"Krusty, this camp was a nightmare. They fed us gruel, they forced us to make wallets for export, and one of the campers was eaten by a bear."
Krusty the Clown,Oh my God.
Bart Simpson,"Well actually, the bear just ate his hat."
Krusty the Clown,Was it a nice hat?
Bart Simpson,Oh yeah.
Krusty the Clown,"Oh my God. Well, I'm gonna make it all up to you. I'm gonna show you kids the time of your lives."

Token Black Panelist, Drederick Tatum... and Mr. Bozwell, the man behind those infamous ""Worst-Dressed Lists"". Mr. Bozwell, can you give us a sneak peek at this year's list?"

Llewellyn Sinclair,Quiet!
Chief Wiggum,All right.
Llewellyn Sinclair,"I am not an easy man to work for. While directing ""Hats Off to Hanukkah,"" I reduced more than one cast member to tears. Did I expect too much from fourth graders? The review ""Play Enjoyed By All"" -- speaks for itself. Those auditioning for the role of Stanley... Take off your shirts."
Llewellyn Sinclair,Take off your shirts! Deshabillez votre chemises! Schnell! Schnell! Schnell!

Llewellyn Sinclair,Next.
Marge Simpson,Love...
Llewellyn Sinclair,Thank you for nothing. You're all terrible. What you ladies don't understand is that Blanche is a delicate flower being trampled by an uncouth lout. Forget it! Just strike the sets! Clear the stage! This production is...
Marge Simpson,"Homie, I didn't get the part... you were right, outside interests are stupid."
Llewellyn Sinclair,Wait a minute.

Llewellyn Sinclair,"Well, would anyone else like a bite of banality?"
Chief Wiggum,I would.
Llewellyn Sinclair,"Stanley, you're, you're pulsing with animal lust. You take Blanche and fling her roughly to the bed."
Ned Flanders,Roger-dodger.
Ned Flanders,Aww... isn't that cute? And me without a camera.
Llewellyn Sinclair,Here. My sister runs a day care center.
Marge Simpson,"Well, I guess a few weeks wouldn't hurt her."

Marge Simpson,"Maggie is allergic to strained pears, and she likes a bottle of warm milk before naptime..."
Ms. Sinclair,"A bottle? Mrs. Simpson, do you know what a baby is saying when she reaches for a bottle?"
Marge Simpson,Ba-ba?
Ms. Sinclair,"She's saying, ""I am a leech."" Our aim here is to develop the ""bottle within."""
Marge Simpson,That sounds awfully harsh.
Ms. Sinclair,"Mrs. Simpson, I don't like to toot my own horn, but we're the only day center in town that's not currently under investigation by the state."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, well. Be a good girl, Maggie."
Ms. Sinclair,"I'm sorry Maggie, we don't allow these here."

Llewellyn Sinclair,"All right, let ham-ateur night in Dixie commence."
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, Llewellyn. I just... I just don't see why Blanche should shove a broken bottle in Stanley's face. Couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle, good humor?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, your ride's here."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, it'll just be a few minutes more!"
Ned Flanders,You're a dame and I'm a fella.
Marge Simpson,"Stanley stop, or I'll tell Stella."
Llewellyn Sinclair,Marge! Marge! I'm asking for white hot rage and you're giving me a hissy fit!
Homer Simpson,"Marge, can I get some change for the candy machine?"
Llewellyn Sinclair,Oh here!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, there's quarters in here!"
Marge Simpson,I just don't see what's so bad about Stanley.

Homer Simpson,So what time does this play start?
Marge Simpson,Why? Are you going?
Homer Simpson,"Well I gotta, don't I?"
Marge Simpson,"I'm sure you won't enjoy it. There's nothing about bowling in the play... Oh wait, there is."
Homer Simpson,Probably not much of it.
Marge Simpson,Why can't you be a little more supportive?
Homer Simpson,"Because I don't care, okay? I can't fake an interest in this, and I'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects."
Marge Simpson,What kooky projects?
Homer Simpson,"You know, the painting class, the First Aid course, that whole Lamaze thing."
Marge Simpson,Why didn't you tell me you felt this way?
Homer Simpson,You know I would never do anything to hurt your feelings. Good night.

Homer Simpson,I'm whizzing with the door open -- and I love it!

Bill,"That was Johnny Calhoun, with ""Gonna Find Me a Genie With a Magic Bikini""."
Marty,"Of course, Johnny's next record was a spoken-word album of his right-wing political views, that kinda killed his career. If you can tell me the name of that album, call our contest line - now!"

Homer Simpson,"Come on TV... gimme some of that sweet, sweet pap!"
Boring Guy,"Let's define our terms, gentleman. Are we talking about redistricting, or are we talking about reapportionment? Because the two are by no means the same."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well... can't win 'em all."
Announcer,We interrupt this public affairs program to bring you a football game.
Homer Simpson,Yesss!

Lisa Simpson,Nothing.

Commentator,"Oh, doctor. A 98-yard triple reverse ties the score at 63-63! We have seen nothing but razzle-dazzle here today. Three visits from Morganna The Kissing Bandit... and the astonishing return of Jim Brown..."

Abraham Lincoln,"Mmm, hmm."
Homer Simpson,I... found... a penny!
Homer Simpson,Could this be the best day of my life?
Homer Simpson,Looks like we have a new champion.
Homer Simpson,"Ah, my beloved family. How was church?"
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"I, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life. And I owe it all to skipping church!"
Marge Simpson,"That's a terrible thing to say. Kids, your father doesn't really mean that."
Homer Simpson,"Like fun I don't. Marge, I'm never going to church again."
Marge Simpson,Homer! Are you actually giving up your faith?
Homer Simpson,"No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, yes."
,
Marge Simpson,"I can't believe you're giving up church, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? I mean, isn't God everywhere?"
Bart Simpson,"Amen, brother."
Homer Simpson,And don't you think that the Almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?
Bart Simpson,"Tell it, daddy!"
Homer Simpson,And what if we picked the wrong religion? Every week we're just making God madder and madder.
Bart Simpson,Testify!
Marge Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Lord, my husband is by no means perfect, but he's a kind, decent man. Please show him the error of his ways."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, come to bed."
Marge Simpson,"No, Homer. He doesn't mean to be sacrilegious, Lord. He just likes to sleep in on Sundays..."
Homer Simpson,Maarge... come to bed Marge...
Homer Simpson,It's good for what ails ya...
Homer Simpson,I can wait all --
Homer Simpson,God?
God,THOU HAST FORSAKEN MY CHURCH!
Homer Simpson,Well... kind of... but...
God,BUT WHAT?
Homer Simpson,And YOU remember... Matthew... 21:17.
Homer Simpson,I'm not a bad guy. I work hard and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?
God,"Hmm, you've got a point there."
God,"You know, sometimes even I'd rather be watching football. Does St. Louis still have a team?"
Homer Simpson,No. They moved to Phoenix.
God,Oh yeah.
Homer Simpson,You know what I really hate about church? Those boring sermons.
God,I couldn't agree more. That Reverend Lovejoy really displeases me. I think I'll give him a canker sore.
Homer Simpson,Give him one for me.
God,I will.
Homer Simpson,"So I figure I should just try to live right, and worship you in my own way."
God,"Homer, it's a deal. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to appear on a tortilla in Mexico."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, can I ask you a question?"
Homer Simpson,"Sure, honey."
Lisa Simpson,Why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy?
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Sweetheart. If I'm wrong, I'll recant on my deathbed."
Homer Simpson,"Hello, my animal friends. Peace be with you."
Homer Simpson,"Guys, please, could you give me five minutes?"
Marge Simpson,"Reverend Lovejoy, I had a bit of an ulterior motive in inviting you to dinner."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,What?!
Marge Simpson,"No, it's nothing bad. I'm just concerned, because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately."
Homer Simpson,"Well, I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing. But then God Himself told me I should seek a new path."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, really?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, he appeared before me in a dream, and I knew that was special 'cause I usually dream about naked... Marge."
Marge Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"So, Homer, you saw the Big Cheese? What'd he look like?"
Homer Simpson,Perfect teeth - nice smell - a class act all the way.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you're crazy. Tell him this is all crazy."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Homer, I'd like you to remember Matthew 7:26 -- ""The foolish man, who built his house on sand."""
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"""And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany, and he lodged there""?"
Homer Simpson,Yeah... think about it.

Homer Simpson,Where are we going?
Sailor,Garbage Island.
,
Marge Simpson,"Let's go, kids."
Bart Simpson,How come we have to go to church and Dad gets to stay home and watch cartoons?
Marge Simpson,"I have a responsibility to raise these children right and unless you change, I'll have to tell them their father is... well, wicked."
Homer Simpson,"Kids, let me tell you about another so-called wicked guy. He had long hair and some ""wild"" ideas and he didn't always do what other people thought was right. And that man's name was... I forget. But the point is... uh, I forget that too. Marge, you know who I'm talking about -- he used to drive that blue car --"
Marge Simpson,"Kids, could you wait outside for us?"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please. Don't make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can't win."
Homer Simpson,There you go again. Always taking someone else's side. Flanders... the water department... God...
Marge Simpson,I'm only going to ask you one last time. Are you sure you won't come with us to church?
Announcer,"Coming up next, ""Make Your Own Ladder."""
Homer Simpson,Very sure.

Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"My friends, the devil walks among us."
Bart Simpson,"Ooop, I got him."

Homer Simpson,"Hey Ganesha, want a peanut?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Please do not offer my god a peanut.
Homer Simpson,"No offense Apu, but when they were handing out religions, you must have been out takin' a whiz."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Mr. Simpson, please pay for your purchases and get out and come again."
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Pride goeth before destruction!
,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, everyone is stupid except me."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, turn down the heat. That's better."

Ned Flanders,Help! Help!
Homer Simpson,"That's right, old friend."
Bart Simpson,Dad!

Marge Simpson,"Yes, the lesson is..."
Homer Simpson,"No, don't tell me, I'll get it... Oh, I know! The Lord is vengeful! O Spiteful One! Show me who to smite, and they shall be smoten!"
Ned Flanders,"Homer, God didn't set your house on fire."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"No, but he was working in the hearts of your friends and neighbors when they went to your aid, be they Christian... Jew... or Miscellaneous..."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Hindu. There are 700 million of us.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Ah, that's super."
Homer Simpson,"I was rude to every one of you... and you saved my life, when you could have just left me to fry, like the proverbial pancake that I am."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie, I'm so glad to hear you say that."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now, would you give church another try?"
Homer Simpson,"I'll be there next Sunday. Front row, center!"

God,Don't feel bad Homer. Nine out of ten religions fail in the first year.
Benjamin Franklin,"That's game, Hendrix!"
Homer Simpson,"God, I gotta ask you somethin'. What's the meaning of life?"
God,"Homer, I can't tell you that."
Homer Simpson,C'mon.

Jack Larson,Mm hm. We think you're the perfect spokesmodel for Laramies. It's part of our new campaign.
Jack Larson,Hmm classy.
Lisa Simpson,
Jack Larson,"Y'see, Lisa, it's been an unlucky year for Laramie. A lot of the people who smoke our product have been... well... dying, heh heh. And we need young smokers to take their place."
Lisa Simpson,I don't want to be a spokesperson for a cigarette company!
Jack Larson,"But you're a role model to young people. And we're thinking of retiring ""Menthol Moose""."
Homer Simpson,Bless you boys.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, those are ice cream men."
Homer Simpson,I know.
,
Lisa Simpson,Stop this float!
Santa Claus,What's the holdup? Go!
Lisa Simpson,I'm tired of being a corporate shill.
Lisa Simpson,From now I will speak out against the evils in society from dog napping to cigarettes.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Before I sing the National Anthem, I'd like to say that college football diverts funds badly needed for education and the arts."
Football Player,Let's get outta here!
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Gentlemen, we need to get Lisa Simpson out, and Amber Dempsy back in. But this glorified-crossing-guard-of-a-Police Chief won't get off his big fat can."
Chief Wiggum,Is it okay if I open these potato chips?
Jack Larson,"Gentlemen, our prayers have been answered. Take a look at our Little Miss Springfield's pageant application."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Roxy, bring in a bottle of champagne."
Chief Wiggum,And some dip for these chips... somethin'.
Kent Brockman,Lisa Simpson is no longer Little Miss Springfield. She was stripped of her crown in a ceremony earlier today.
Kent Brockman,"Well, that's obviously the wrong footage. Uh, but it does seem the father of the deposed beauty queen, Homer Simpson, filled out the pageant application incorrectly. In the area under ""Do not write in the space"" he wrote ""okay."""
,
Homer Simpson,If it wasn't for me you'd still be queen. You must hate me.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant?"
Homer Simpson,I don't know. Was I drunk?
Lisa Simpson,"Possibly. But the point is, you wanted me to feel better about myself. And I do."
Homer Simpson,Really?
Lisa Simpson,Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson,Will you remember this the next
Homer Simpson,time I wreck your life?
Lisa Simpson,It's a deal.
Kent Brockman,"And now, my exclusive interview with his Holiness, Pope John Paul II."
Kent Brockman,"That's it. I cannot work under these conditions. If anybody wants me, I'll be downstairs at McDougals. Call the weekend guy, I don't care."
Grampa Simpson,"Happy birthday, Bart."
,
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Grampa."
Marge Simpson,Where'd you get all the money?
Grampa Simpson,"The government. I didn't earn it. I don't need it. But if they miss one payment, I'll raise hell."
Bart Simpson,Hey Homer - where's your present?
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? With what?
Homer Simpson,"I mean don't worry, son. I forgot to get you a present. But I swear on my father's grave..."
Grampa Simpson,Hey!
Homer Simpson,I will get you one now!
,
,
Homer Simpson,Do you sell toys?
Shopkeeper,We sell forbidden objects from places men fear to tread. We also sell frozen yogurt... which I call frogurt!
Homer Simpson,"Well, I need something for my son's birthday."
Shopkeeper,Perhaps this will please the gentleman.
Shopkeeper,"Take this object. But beware, it carries a terrible curse."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, that's bad."
Shopkeeper,But it comes with a free frogurt.
Homer Simpson,That's good.
Shopkeeper,The frogurt is also cursed.
Homer Simpson,That's bad.
Shopkeeper,But you get your choice of topping.
Homer Simpson,That's good.
Shopkeeper,The toppings contain potassium benzoate.
Shopkeeper,That's bad.
Homer Simpson,Can I go now?
,
Homer Simpson,"Happy birthday, son!"
Bart Simpson,Great Caesar's Ghost! A talking Krusty doll!
Krusty Doll,I'm Krusty the Clown and I love you very much.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, Dad, this is the best birthday I've ever had."
Grampa Simpson,"That doll is evil, I tells ya. Evil! EEEVIL!"
Marge Simpson,"Grampa, you said that about all the presents."
Grampa Simpson,I just want attention.
Kent Brockman,"...And in environmental news, scientist have announced that Springfield's air is now only dangerous to children and the elderly."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Krusty Doll,I'm Krusty the Clown and I don't like you.
Homer Simpson,
Krusty Doll,I'm Krusty the Clown and I'm going to kill you!
Homer Simpson,Didn't even pull the string that time.
Krusty Doll,"I said I'm going to kill you. You, Homer Simpson."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, what's wrong?"
Homer Simpson,That doll tried to kill me!
Bart Simpson,"I'd say that the pressure's finally gotten to Dad, but what pressure?"
Homer Simpson,Don't leave me alone with him.
Homer Simpson,MY BALONEY HAS A FIRST NAME / IS H-O-M-E-R / MY BALONEY HAS A SECOND NAME / IT'S H-O-M-E-R.
Homer Simpson,
Patty Bouvier,There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality.
Krusty Doll,"Hey, baby. Get comfortable. Relax. It's a little hot for that cheerleader outfit, don't you think?"
Krusty Doll,You think your dirty socks can stop me? Well... they are making me dizzy...
,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, Dolly."
Gangster,"Arrivederci, Vito."
Man,I was a fool to think anyone would want nude pictures of Whoopi Goldberg.
Man,What the?...
,
,
Homer Simpson,And that is that.
,
Krusty Doll,"Guess who, Fat Boy?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Marge, look!"
Marge Simpson,Oh my God.
Homer Simpson,The doll's trying to kill me and the toaster's been laughing at me!
Homer Simpson,Ew. Dog water.
Marge Simpson,"Your doll is trying to kill my husband!... Yes, I'll hold."
Gulliver Dark,EVERYBODY LOVES A CLOWN / SO WHY DON'T YOU?
Repairman,Yep. Here's your problem.
Repairman,"Someone set this thing to ""EVIL""."
Krusty Doll,"I love you, Homer."
Homer Simpson,Come here you.
Krusty Doll,Here ya' go buddy.
Homer Simpson,Did you walk the dog?
Krusty Doll,"Yeah, he buried me a couple a times."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, dogs like to bury old junk."
Krusty Doll,"Yeah, you stupid idiot."
,
Krusty Doll,"Oh, what a day. Homer made me give him a sponge bath. But coming home to you makes it all worth while."
Krusty Doll,"Here, let me get that for ya."
,
Homer Simpson,"... So then, his wife comes through the door!!!"
Bart Simpson,So?
Homer Simpson,Did I mention she was dead?
Lisa Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,"Well, she was. And she hit him in the head with a golf club!"
Bart Simpson,And?
Homer Simpson,Don't you remember? He went golfing all the time and it really bugged her.
Lisa Simpson,You said he went bowling!
Homer Simpson,
Grampa Simpson,"Homer, I've coughed up scarier stuff than that."
Bart Simpson,"Grampa, why don't you tell us a story? You've led an interesting life."
Grampa Simpson,That's a lie and you know it. But I have seen a lot of movies...

Charlie,"Candy Apple Island, what have they got there?"
Carl Carlson,Apes. But they're not so big.
Otto Mann,"Hey, who's this Homer Dude?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"He's either a fifty foot prehistoric ape, or a tourist trap concocted by the ape island jaycees. Either way, we're going ashore."
Marge Simpson,Am I going too?
Grampa Simpson,Garsh darn it.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Of course. We wouldn't think of going without the bait... uh, that is, the bait-thing beauty -- The bathing beauty. I covered that up pretty well."

Marge Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, we don't want to kill him, shoot him around the groin and belly."
Lenny Leonard,"Hey Homer, cut it out. Come on, quit eatin' me."
Lenny Leonard,"Ow! Nice shot, Carl."

C. Montgomery Burns,

C. Montgomery Burns,"Ladies and gentlemen, in his native land he was a king. But he comes before you in chains, for your own amusement. Presenting Homer, the Eighth Wonder of the World!"

Marge Simpson,"Thank you, dear. Now be good for Grampa while we're at the parent/ teacher meeting. We'll bring back dinner."
Lisa Simpson,What are we going to have?
Homer Simpson,Well that depends on what your teachers say. If you've been good... pizza. If you've been bad... uh... ... let's see... poison.

Homer Simpson,Are you kidding? Lisa turned out perfect. I won't stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing Lisa!
Marge Simpson,We're talking about Bart.
Homer Simpson,Oh. That guy.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,I think the problem here is discipline. If Bart does something wrong you should punish him.
Marge Simpson,"Well, we try, but he has this way of making us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in."
Homer Simpson,He's the boy you love to hate.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Well, you've got to start being firm with him. I believe with persistent discipline even the poorest student can end up becoming... oh... say Chief Justice of the Supreme Court."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, right. Like you're gonna let me go hungry. I'll be eatin' that pizza in five minutes."
Homer Simpson,Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. What great men he would join. John Marshall... Charles Evans Hughes... Warren Burger... mmm burger.
Marge Simpson,And what if we don't?

Grampa Simpson,You already put me in a home.
Homer Simpson,"Then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on ""60 Minutes."""
Grampa Simpson,I'll be good.
Grampa Simpson,Look what your bad egg of a son did to my teeth!
Homer Simpson,"Dad, you and your stories... ""Bart broke my teeth""... ""the nurses are stealing my money""... ""this thing on my neck is getting bigger""..."
Marge Simpson,Now this is exactly what Bart's teacher was talking about. Our son did something wrong and you look the other way.
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, look at that hangdog expression. He's learned his lesson. Let's get him a present."
Marge Simpson,"Please, Homer. Why do I always have to be the bad guy?"
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right. Young man, since you broke Grampa's teeth -- he gets to break yours."
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, this is gonna be sweet."
Marge Simpson,"No, no, no."
Grampa Simpson,Oh.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, we're sending you to bed without your supper."
Marge Simpson,Bart! Stop being confident.
Bart Simpson,There must be something to eat around here.
Bart Simpson,"Gee, maybe they mean it this time. From now on I guess I'd better straighten up and fly..."

Bart Simpson,Indeed I did.
Homer Simpson,"Hey you goats, get outta here!"
Homer Simpson,"Boy, you're going to have to be punished for this."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, you could punish me. But that means you'd have to think of a punishment, sit here and make sure I do it..."
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Or you could let me go play with Milhouse while you spend the afternoon watching unpredictable Mexican sitcoms.
Bumblebee Man,"Ayy, el estomago!"
Homer Simpson,"Run along, ya little scamp."
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Jin-gle Bells, Jin-gle Bells..."
Homer Simpson,Bart! Why are you doing that?
Bart Simpson,I'unno.

Homer Simpson,"No tricks, boy. I said I'm gonna punish you and come Hell or high water I... wait a minute..."
Homer Simpson,Ice cream truck!
Homer Simpson,"Me, me. I was here first!"
Homer Simpson,"Now, what were we talking about, boy?"
Bart Simpson,Uh... we were talking about the time you beat jury duty.
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. The trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.
Marge Simpson,We're home.
Lisa Simpson,We got beets!
Marge Simpson,"Bart, are you pulling up the carpet?"
Bart Simpson,Yuh - huh.
Marge Simpson,Why are you letting him do this?
Homer Simpson,I'unno.
Marge Simpson,Well punish him!
Homer Simpson,"All right. All right. Bart, go to your room."
Bart Simpson,See ya in the funny pages.
Marge Simpson,How could you let this happen?
Homer Simpson,How could you let this happen?
Marge Simpson,I wasn't here!
Homer Simpson,Oh. How convenient.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, do you want your son to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or a sleazy male stripper?"
Homer Simpson,Can't he be both like the late Earl Warren?
Marge Simpson,Earl Warren wasn't a stripper.
Homer Simpson,Now who's being naive.
Marge Simpson,"Look, you have to help discipline your son."
Homer Simpson,"All right, Marge. I swear to you, the next time he does something wrong I'll punish him and make it stick."
Kent Brockman,"Tonight on Eye On Springfield, we meet a man who's been hiccuping for forty-five years."
Man,Kill me... Kill me...
Kent Brockman,But first we'll examine the growing Itchy & Scratchy mania with their new movie premiering today!
Bart Simpson,I got my ticket.
Kent Brockman,"I'm here live in Korea to give you a first hand look at how American cartoons are made. But first, let's take a look back at the year 1928. A year when you might have seen Al Capone dancing the Charleston on top of a flagpole."
Kent Brockman,"It was also the year of the very first Scratchy cartoon, entitled ""That Happy Cat""."
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, but the punishment stands."
Kent Brockman,"The film did very poorly. But the following year Scratchy was teamed up with a psychotic young mouse named Itchy. And cartoon history was made. Here's their first cartoon together: ""Steamboat Itchy."""
Itchy,"Oh me, oh my!"
Kent Brockman,During the war Itchy & Scratchy put their differences aside and teamed up to fight a bigger foe.
Kent Brockman,We'll be back with a real life Itchy & Scratchy. A rabid mouse in Boston who attacked and killed a small cat.
Homer Simpson,"Bart, didn't I ask you to watch Maggie?"
Bart Simpson,Sounds like something you'd say.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, where is she?"
,
,
Marge Simpson,Oh my Lord!
,
Chief Wiggum,"Aw, isn't that cute. A baby driving a car."
Chief Wiggum,"And look, there's a dog driving a bus."
Driver,Hey!
Snake Jailbird,All rrright. Time for a crime spree.
,
Homer Simpson,"All right, boy. This calls for the biggest punishment I've ever handed down. And this time it's gonna stick!"
Bart Simpson,"Come on, Homer. This isn't funny."
Homer Simpson,"Damn right. Bart, you can't go to see that Itchy & Scratchy movie. Ever!"
Bart Simpson,
Snake Jailbird,"Oh, nnnooo. Beta."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, you gotta let me see that movie. Can't you just give me a spanking?"
Bart Simpson,"Come on, go nuts."
Homer Simpson,Don't point that thing at me. I said you're not going to the movie and I'm sticking to it.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I agree that Bart should be punished, but the Itchy and Scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. How would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?"
Homer Simpson,Hmm...
,
,
Homer Simpson,"YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY/ I'VE GOT LOVE IN MY TUMMY/ AND I FEEL LIKE LOVIN' YOU..."
Homer Simpson,"... LOVE YOU, SUCH A SWEET THING/ GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT THING..."
Guy,I regret nothing!
Homer Simpson,"Someday you'll thank me for this, son."
Bart Simpson,Not bloody likely.
Homer Simpson,"No, it's true. You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher's mitt. But, my dad wouldn't get it for me. So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. The doctor thought I might have brain damage."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, what's the point of this story?"
Homer Simpson,I like stories.
Bart Simpson,"Look, can I please go to the movie?"
Homer Simpson,"I know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but I can't go back on it. You're welcome to watch anything you want on TV."
Bart Simpson,TV sucks.
Homer Simpson,"I know you're upset right now, so I'll pretend you didn't say that."
,
Announcer,The master craftsman can make three mailboxes an hour.
Bart Simpson,"I'm not licked yet. I can entertain myself. No matter how good a movie is, it can't compare to the imagination of a small boy."
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,How was it?
Lisa Simpson,It wasn't that great.
Bart Simpson,Be honest.
Lisa Simpson,"It was the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life. And you wouldn't believe the celebrities who did cameos. Dustin Hoffman, Michael Jackson... of course they didn't use their real names, but you could tell it was them."
Bart Simpson,Lisa.
Lisa Simpson,Sorry Bart.
,
Bart Simpson,It's just not the same.
Milhouse Van Houten,I've seen the Itchy & Scratchy Movie 13 times.
Nelson Muntz,I've seen it 17 times.
Bart Simpson,You guys must be gettin' pretty tired of that movie by now.
Milhouse Van Houten,No one who saw the movie would say that!
Nelson Muntz,Let's get him!
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, we'd like to talk to you."
Homer Simpson,But then I won't be watching TV. You can see the bind I'm in.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you've got to let Bart see that movie. I've never seen him like this. He has the demented melancholia of a Tennessee Williams heroine."
Homer Simpson,Don't you think I know that?
Marge Simpson,"Well, it's been two months. You laid down the law and I'm proud of you. But I think we've gotten through to him."
Homer Simpson,"Ah, sweet soft-hearted Marge. You just can't see the big picture. If I stick to my guns, the boy could wind up Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. If I fail, the best he could do is judge at a ""Mister Tight Buns"" competition. I can't let that happen, I won't let that happen and I can't let that happen."
,
Bart Simpson,"One for ""Itchy and Scratchy""."
Booth Attendant,We promised your dad we wouldn't.
,
,
Kent Brockman,"I'm here at the Springfield Aztec Theater where, after eight months and nine Academy Awards, the Itchy and Scratchy movie is showing for the last time. Tomorrow, a new movie, starring Liza Minnelli and Mickey Rourke will open. Will it be as successful? Only time will tell."
Bart Simpson,"Well, Dad, I guess you won."
Homer Simpson,"No, son, we both won. You don't know it now, but I've started you on the road to somewhere very special."
,
Bart Simpson,"Well, I'll be. The Itchy and Scratchy Movie."
Bart Simpson,Come on. What d'ya say?
Homer Simpson,All right. I think you've learned your lesson.
Bart Simpson,One senior citizen and one Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
Homer Simpson,I'll get it son.
Booth Attendant,That'll be six hundred and fifty dollars.
Homer Simpson,
,
Customer,One Soylent Green. Hold the butter.
Homer Simpson,Mmm... Soylent Green.
Homer Simpson,Which one's the mouse?
Bart Simpson,Itchy.
Homer Simpson,Itchy's a jerk.
Bart Simpson,Yeah.
,
Marge Simpson,"Resident... occupant... hmm, free sample of ""Lemon Time""..."
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, give it here."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's dish washing liquid!"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?"
Marge Simpson,Oooh! They're having a retirement party for someone at the plant.
Homer Simpson,I wish I could retire.
Homer Simpson,"Boy, that'd be sweet."
Ned Flanders,"Howdy-do, neighbor! Good pipe weather. Thought I'd fire up the briar."
Homer Simpson,Can't talk -- busy.
Ned Flanders,Okely-dokely-do.
Marge Simpson,Did you notice how slanted he looked?
Homer Simpson,All part of God's great plan.
Marge Simpson,I think one side of our house is sinking.
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
Homer Simpson,The half-assed approach to foundation repair.
MCCLURE,"Hello, I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such instructional videos as ""Mothballing Your Battleship"" and ""Dig Your Own Grave - and Save!"" Now over the next six hours I'll be taking you through the do's and do not do's of foundation repair. Ready?"
Homer Simpson,Ready!
MCCLURE,"First, patch the cracks in the slab using a latex patching compound and a patching trowel..."
Homer Simpson,"Hand me my patching trowel, boy."
Homer Simpson,Hmm.
MCCLURE,"Now, do you have extruded polyvinyl foam insulation?"
Homer Simpson,No.
MCCLURE,Good. Assemble the aluminum J-channel using self-furring screws. Install.
Homer Simpson,Wha-do I do...
MCCLURE,After applying brushable coating to the panels...
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute...
MCCLURE,....you'll need some corrosion-resistant metal stucco lath.
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute...
MCCLURE,If you can't find metal stucco lath....
Homer Simpson,Uh huh?
MCCLURE,Use carbon-fiber stucco lath.
Homer Simpson,
MCCLURE,"Now, parge the lath..."
Homer Simpson,Did you see the bubble?
Waylon Smithers,A CERTAIN MAN...
Girls,A CERTAIN MAN...
Contractor,"I'm afraid the whole west side of your house is sinking. I figure it's gonna cost you... oh, eighty-five hundred."
Homer Simpson,Forget it. You're not the only foundation guy in town!
Homer Simpson,"Let's see, foundation repair... Ah, here we are..."
Kent Brockman,"... Leaving the Vice President in charge. And now, Leaning Tower of Pisa eat your heart out and move over! This is one story that's not on the level!"
Bart Simpson,"Behold the horrors of the Slanty Shanty. See the twisted creatures that dwell within. Meet ""Cue Ball,"" the man with no hair!"
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Woman,He's hideous!
Marge Simpson,We have to do something...
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it'll cost eighty-five hundred dollars. We only have five hundred in the bank. That leaves... eighty- hundred we need."
Marge Simpson,I could get a job.
Homer Simpson,Hey! Then I could follow my dream. Living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts.
Homer Simpson,"March 15... I wish I'd brought a TV. Oh God, how I miss TV."
Marge Simpson,"Hmm, I think you have to keep your job too."

Marge Simpson,We're here for the retirement party.
Maitre D',Follow the Headless Brakeman.
Headless Brakeman,Power plant retirement party. Ow! Right this way.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Tonight, we've all come to honor a close friend of ours..."
Homer Simpson,Bo-ring!

C. Montgomery Burns,Burns!
Marley,Do you mind if I say a few words?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, me, me, me ""I need all the attention just because it's my party, eh!"""
Marley,"Please don't make me retire! My job is the only thing that keeps me alive! I never married, and my dog is dead!"
Marley,I'm not finished.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, yes you are."
C. Montgomery Burns,"With the departure of Mr. Marley, there will now be an entry-level position open in Sector 7G. Now get out. The bar is closed."
Crowd,
,
Marge Simpson,Maybe I should apply for that job.
,
Marge Simpson,"Where does the Bible say ""racket?""...."
Homer Simpson,"It's in there. Look, Marge we just don't need the money that bad."
Marge Simpson,"Well, Lisa, I finished my resume."
Lisa Simpson,Uh... I think it needs a little padding.
Marge Simpson,What are you putting in there?...
Lisa Simpson,Up-up-up. When I'm done.
Marge Simpson,Chauffeur... seamstress...
Marge Simpson,curator of large mammals?
Homer Simpson,Marge have you seen my lunch box?
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I see."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, they expect you to lie a little."
Marge Simpson,Worked for the Carter administration?
Lisa Simpson,"Well, you voted for him... twice!"
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, sh! Someone may be listening."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Oh, I thought Muddy Waters wrote that song."
Waylon Smithers,This resume is very impressive. Let me be the first to say: Kadibu [kadeeboo] Kazini [kazeenee].
Marge Simpson,What?
Waylon Smithers,Welcome aboard. I guess my Swahili's not as good as yours.
Marge Simpson,Yeah...
Waylon Smithers,"Sorry, the position has been filled."
Marley,Oh dear.
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're making a big mistake. I'm going to see you all day at work and all night at home..."
Homer Simpson,"And that's good! But, here's the bad part... uh... uh... Ooh, look at that headline: ""Canada To Hold Referendum."" Sorry Marge, can't talk now."
Marge Simpson,"We need the money, and my life is pretty boring. Last week some Jehovah's Witnesses came to the door and I wouldn't let them leave. They snuck away when I went in the kitchen to get more lemonade."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, lemonade is good."
Lisa Simpson,I think it's wonderful. Mom and Dad side by side at the power plant. You'll be just like Marie and Pierre Curie.
Homer Simpson,Wha dey do?
Lisa Simpson,They discovered radium. Then they both died of radiation poisoning.
Bart Simpson,Hmmm!
Man,It's the Curies. We must flee!
Bart Simpson,Cool!
,
Homer Simpson,"Now, Marge, just remember, if something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can't speak English. Ah, Tibor, how many times have you saved my butt ."
,
Grampa Simpson,"Maggie, your baby-sitter's here."
Grampa Simpson,What's that mean?
Grampa Simpson,"Whoa, you must be sick."
,
Grampa Simpson,"Whoa, you must be sick. Let's see. What's old doc Washburn prescribe?"
Grampa Simpson,Do you have Dropsy? The Grippe? Scrofula? The Vapors? Jungle Rot? Dandy Fever? Poor man's gout? Housemaid's knee? Climactic pooball? The staggers? Dum-dum fever?...

Waylon Smithers,"And this is your office. That idiot Tibor lost the key, but you can jimmy it open with a credit card."
Waylon Smithers,"Well, have fun."
Marge Simpson,But... what do I do?
Waylon Smithers,"Marge, please. According to your resume, you invented this machine."

Bart Simpson,"I'm halfway through it, I swear!"
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,
,
Homer Simpson,Marge what're you doing? It's lunch time.
Marge Simpson,I'll just be a minute. I have to finish this paperwork.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Marge, Marge, let's file this under ""R"" for arrivederci."
Marge Simpson,"But, where does it go?"
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, baby. That tube'll know what to do."
,
Grampa Simpson,"Good news, boy. I found a pharmacy that carries leeches! Well, it wasn't exactly a pharmacy... more of a bait shop."
Bart Simpson,"Look, Grampa, I'm fine! I really don't need any more home remedies."
Grampa Simpson,"Oral thermometer, my eye! Think warm thoughts, boy, 'cause this is mighty cold."
Bart Simpson,Aaaagh!

Marge Simpson,Ow!
C. Montgomery Burns,Too close.
C. Montgomery Burns,Hello!
Marge Simpson,Mr. Burns!
C. Montgomery Burns,No need for alarm. I just came to give you the orchids and fragrant bath oils I lavish upon all my employees.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, aren't you nice. Gee, this makes me wonder why morale here is so low."
Man #2,I am the angel of death. The time of purification is at hand.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, who cares. Marge, what can we do?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, you could give them healthier snacks... theme days..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You mean like ""Child labor Day""?"
Marge Simpson,"Hmm, actually, I was thinking of ""Funny Hat Day."""
C. Montgomery Burns,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, and how about piping in some Tom Jones music? That always cheers me up."
C. Montgomery Burns,It's working! It's working! And the healthy snacks are on their way.
Homer Simpson,You can't take our donuts!
Donut Man,"All right, anyone else want to be a hero?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Marge, I'm giving you a raise and a new office... right next to mine."

Grampa Simpson,"Bart, is that light green?"
Bart Simpson,Yeah.
Grampa Simpson,It better be!
,
Marge Simpson,"Homie, what's wrong?"
Homer Simpson,I'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me... friends... co-workers... Tibor... I never thought it'd be my own wife.
Marge Simpson,"Well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder."
Homer Simpson,Are you kidding? I work like a Japanese Beaver.
Marge Simpson,Oh really? I came to see you three times today. Twice you were sleeping and once you were kicking that ball of electrical tape around.
Homer Simpson,"Well, I won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks I'm lazy. I'm gonna go right down stairs, unfold the couch, unroll a sleeping bag... Eh, goodnight."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers. You know that dream where you're in bed and they fly in through the window?"
Waylon Smithers,"You've been reading my Wish Book, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, Smithers, I want you to arrange a party for two at my estate. Marge, me, and do you think you could dig up Al Jolson?"
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, you remember we did that once before?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, that's right, he's dead. And rather pungent. The rest of that night is something I'd like to forget. All right, then. Bring me that crooner she likes so much... Tom Jones."
Carl Carlson,These spurs are killin' me.
Lenny Leonard,Ayyy -- sit on it.
Carl Carlson,"Lenny, 50's Day is next Wednesday."
Lenny Leonard,I gotta go home and change!

Marge Simpson,Here's your money.
Contractor,You know the problem here was water leakage. If you just buy a fifty cent washer --
Homer Simpson,I've got a better idea -- get the hell out!
Contractor,"Look, I've got some washers in my truck. I'll give you one."
,
Waylon Smithers,Tom Jones?
Tom Jones,Yes?
Waylon Smithers,I was wondering if you'd be interested in performing at a private party.
Tom Jones,"Sorry, Mate, I don't do private parties."
Waylon Smithers,"Then, perhaps you should look in this suitcase."
Tom Jones,"All right, but I don't see..."
Tom Jones,
Waylon Smithers,"Pleasant dreams, Mr. Jones."
,
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Bart, to avoid this test you've had smallpox, the bends and that unfortunate bout of rabbies."

Bart Simpson,

Krusty the Clown,Her claws are really digging into my skull.
Animal Handler,She can crush clams with them.
Krusty the Clown,"Get it off, get it off!"
Animal Handler,Here we have an Alaskan Timber Wolf. He weighs 240 pounds and his jaws can bite through a parking meter. He does get spooked by loud noises.
Krusty the Clown,Loud? That's our secret word for the day!
Animal Handler,Oh my God!
Krusty the Clown,
Animal Handler,She must think you're after her eggs.
Krusty the Clown,I only ate one!

Edna Krabappel-Flanders,You're wasting valuable test time.
,
Marge Simpson,"Mr. Burns, you want to see me?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Actually, I was wondering if you were free for a little get-together tonight. Dinner, dancing and ... Mr. Tom Jones."

Marge Simpson,Oh my goodness!
Tom Jones,
Marge Simpson,My husband will be so excited.
C. Montgomery Burns,"You... have a husband? Yes, I can picture him now... rugged good looks... sweater knotted about his shoulders... curly locks shining in the sun like spun gold..."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, Mr. Burns gave me another raise today."
Homer,The senile old fool.
C. Montgomery Burns,You're fired!
Marge Simpson,You can't fire me just because I'm married. I'm going to sue the pants off you.
C. Montgomery Burns,You don't have to sue me to get my pants off.

Groundskeeper Willie,"Hey, Wolfie, put down that hors d'oeuvre... It's time for the main course!"
Groundskeeper Willie,"Back to class, lad, nothin' to see here."
,
Bart Simpson,Here's my test.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Bart, I'm not even going to grade this until you tell me the truth about what happened out there."
Bart Simpson,"The truth is, there was no wolf. I faked the whole thing. I'm just going to lie on the floor now. Please don't let me swallow my tongue."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"There, doesn't it feel better to tell the truth?"
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Oh dear.
,
Grampa Simpson,"All right, now boy, we've got to rub some garlic on you before the next full moon."

,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, Marge, look at all those flies buzzing around your head -- you're a mess, woman ."
,
Marge Simpson,"So, do you think I have a case?"
Lionel Hutz,"Mrs. Simpson, you're in luck. Your sexual harassment suit is just the thing I need to rebuild my shattered practice. Care to join me in a belt of scotch?"
Marge Simpson,It's 9:30 in the morning.
Lionel Hutz,"Yeah, but I haven't slept in days..."
Lionel Hutz,Last chance...
Lionel Hutz,"Oh, yeah."

Lionel Hutz,"Mr. Burns we've got witnesses, precedent and a paper trail a mile long."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, I have ten high-priced lawyers."
Lionel Hutz,
Homer Simpson,He left his briefcase. Hey! It's full of shredded newspapers.
Marge Simpson,"Well, I guess that's it. People like us can't afford justice. Come on Homie, let's go before he fires you too."
Homer Simpson,"No! Mr. Burns, I'm not leaving until you say you're sorry for what you did to my wife."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You love her, too."
Homer Simpson,Damn right!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Homer, I want you to show this woman the time of her life."

Sylvia Winfield,"Mr. Simpson, my husband and I have decided to move..."
Homer Simpson,"Gonna run out the clock in Florida, eh?"

Homer Simpson,Mmm... no.
Sylvia Winfield,"Second, could you please take in your jack-o-lanterns from past Halloweens."
Homer Simpson,Mmm... no.
Sylvia Winfield,And please cover your garbage. It's attracting wildlife.

Marge Simpson,That medicine's not for you.
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Marge. Maybe I'm not getting enough ...estrogen."
Marge Simpson,Gimme that.
Captain,"Ahoy, maties. Had your fill of tacos? Would ye sooner eat a bilge rat than another burger? Then come for all-you-can-eat seafood at the ""FRYIN' DUTCHMAN."""
Homer Simpson,
Captain,Is it more iced tea ye be needing?
Wife,Okay.
Captain,"Set sail for ""The Fryin' Dutchman."""
Homer Simpson,"Aye, aye Captain! Marge, we're going to that restaurant."
Marge Simpson,"But I think I'm allergic to seafood. The last time I ate shrimp, my throat closed up and I went into convulsions."
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, shrimp."
,
Woman,"Now, I don't know much about haggling or bargaining, so why don't we just agree to pay whatever the Winfields want?"
Price,That could work.
Man,What was that?
Price,Sigh.
,
Homer Simpson,"There you are! Thought you could get away, huh?"
Woman,Goodbye.
Price,
,
,
Lisa Simpson,I don't think we should be down here.
Bart Simpson,"Nervous, Lis? I don't blame you. This is where the Winfields hid their mutated son."
Lisa Simpson,Bart! The Winfields didn't have a son.
Bart Simpson,See that sock over there? It was his only friend.
Bart Simpson,"Hello, Lisa. Here in the dark you won't need those eyes. Let me have them."

Marge Simpson,That's sweet.
Marge Simpson,"... and finally, Moe's Tavern has contributed a coupon as their way of saying ""Welcome to Springfield."""
Mrs. Powers,"Thank you, this is all so nice. I actually had some doubts about moving to Springfield. Especially after that Time cover story, ""America's Worst City."""
Marge Simpson,You could see our house in that photo.
Mrs. Powers,Oh.
Marge Simpson,And this is for the man of the house... which I guess... is you.
Mrs. Powers,"I guess I should explain. Laura's father and I divorced two years ago. Oh, they're so sweet when you marry them, but soon it's just career, career, career."
Homer Simpson,My hammock! Do you understand? Mine! Don't look that way.
Marge Simpson,
Bart Simpson,I bet you don't know this one. How'd you like a Hertz Donut?
Bart Simpson,Oh.
Laura Powers,"Hurts, don't it?"
Homer Simpson,"...All you can eat, ha!"
Bart Simpson,"Uh, right. Do you know what a Wet Willie is?"
Laura Powers,Is it this?

Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Hey, what the --"
DOLPH,That chick's messin' with our minds.
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Let's get outta here.
Laura Powers,"Now, where were we? Oh yeah, I was gonna tell your fortune."
Bart Simpson,Huh?

Bart Simpson,Whoa!
Laura Powers,"There's your mansion. There's the tennis court... and there's the swimming pool! See you later, Bart!"
Bart Simpson,I'll never wash this hand again.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, make Bart wash his hand."

Bart Simpson,Silence!
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Maybe it's time I wash my hand.

Mrs. Powers,I'll send Laura over to baby-sit as soon as she gets home.
Homer Simpson,"Great. Oh, uh... and there was something else. Something I was supposed to tiptoe around..."
Mrs. Powers,My divorce.
Homer Simpson,"That's it! Whew, I'm glad one of us remembered. That could have been embarrassing."
Lisa Simpson,Homer.
Mrs. Powers,"Well I know what you're thinking and the answer is yes, I want to be fixed up with one of your friends as soon as you can arrange it. After all, Homer, I do have the normal appetites."
Homer Simpson,"Heh heh, I know what you mean. Just let me make sure we're not talking about food."
Mrs. Powers,I'm not.
Homer Simpson,"Right. Me neither. We're talkin' about sex, right?"
Mrs. Powers,Right.
Homer Simpson,I hear you loud and clear.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, are you taking a bath?"
Bart Simpson,Yes I am. And it would be nice to have a little privacy around here for a change.
Lisa Simpson,"This wouldn't have anything to do with Laura coming over, would it?"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, sometimes a guy just likes his skin to look its yellowest."
Bart Simpson,"Why, Laura. What a pleasant surprise."
Laura Powers,Cute. What do you guys want for dinner?
Lisa Simpson,I don't care. Ask Hef over there.
Bart Simpson,Lady's choice.

Guy #1,Sometimes I think you want to fail.
Guy #2,Shut up. Just shut up.

Bart Simpson,Now that is good Labneh.

Waiter,Yes.

Waiter,Excellent choice... and for the gentleman?
Homer Simpson,All you can eat. All you can eat.
Waiter,"All right. When you're ready, take this plate over..."
Chef,"Please don't take the steam tray, sir."
,

Lionel Hutz,"Mr. Simpson, this is the most blatant case of fraudulent advertising since my suit against the film ""The Neverending Story."""

Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!

Bart Simpson,I'm here to see my Grampa.
Old Man,"Here I am, sonny."

Grampa Simpson,"Bart! Ah, you remembered my birthday."
Bart Simpson,Huh? Oh. I sure did!... Here's a bus schedule.
Grampa Simpson,Wow! Fits right in my pocket!
Bart Simpson,"Grampa, I need some advice. Did you ever have a crush on an older woman?"
Grampa Simpson,"I had a crush on the oldest woman. One hundred and twenty years old, she was. Here's a picture of her delivering Eubie Blake."
Bart Simpson,What happened?
Grampa Simpson,"She fell in with that Guinness Book of Records crowd. Suddenly, she didn't have any time for me. I wore a 15 pound beard of bees for that woman, but it just wasn't enough."

Homer Simpson,Uhh... can't you see I'm reading the uh...
Homer Simpson,"..._______ calendar? Hmm... Ooh, Mostly Mozart is in town."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, Bart's at a very curious age. As his father, I think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about...hmmm, you know."
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, I think he should learn about it the same way I did."
Marge Simpson,Are you sure...?
Homer Simpson,"Maybe you're right. Now, if you'll excuse us, this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, if there's a really special girl and she likes some clod who's beneath her, what should you do?"
Homer Simpson,"Son, a woman is a lot like, uh... ... a refrigerator. They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and ... Oh, wait a minute, actually, a woman is more like a beer! They smell good -- they look good -- you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You want to drink another woman!"
Homer Simpson,"So I says, ""Yeah, if you want that money, come and find it 'cause I don't know where it is you baloney..."" You make me wanna retch..."
Bart Simpson,How can I get her to notice me?
Laura Powers,"Meet me at the treehouse, Bart. And come alone."

Jimbo Jones,"Uh no, Principal Skinner."
Seymour Skinner,"Very well, I'll continue to wait."
Bart Simpson,How can you like that guy?
Laura Powers,I don't know. Maybe 'cause he's an outlaw. You know that dead body they found behind the mayor's house?
Bart Simpson,Jimbo killed him?
Laura Powers,"No, but he poked him with a stick."
Jimbo Jones,"Hey Laura, Dr. Tongue has arrived."
Laura Powers,"That's him, Bart."
Jimbo Jones,Who's the dork?
Laura Powers,"Leave him alone, he's just a kid."
Bart Simpson,I'll show them who's just a kid.

Lisa Simpson,"Good luck in your trumped-up law suit, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, that means a lot to me."

Lionel Hutz,And when you couldn't find one?

Jimbo Jones,Can I have my shirt back?
Laura Powers,"Well, Bart, you were right about him."

Dr. Nick Riviera,"Hi, everybody!"
Med Students,Hi Dr. Nick!
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Now if something should go wrong, let's not get the law involved. One hand washes the other -- Ooh, that reminds me."
Dr. Nick Riviera,These gloves came free with my toilet brush.
Dr. Nick Riviera,What the hell is that?
,
Patty Bouvier,"Marge, this is Andre."
Handsome Young Man,Hello...
Patty Bouvier,I think you two would make a lovely couple.
Marge Simpson,My husband is still alive!

Andre,Not me.

Moe Szyslak,Let's have a minute of silent prayer for our good friend Homer Simpson.
Barney Gumble,How long has it been?
Moe Szyslak,Six seconds.
Barney Gumble,Do we have to start over?
Moe Szyslak,"Hell, no."
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Poor Mister Homer. Could it be that my snack treats are responsible for his wretched health?
Customer,Gimme some jerky.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Would you like some vodka with that?
Customer,"Oh, what the Hell, sure."
,
Nurse,"Doctor, what's wrong? Don't you know where to make the incision?"
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Alright Nick, don't panic. Think back to Med school."
,
Young Riviera,"Seriously baby, I can prescribe anything I want."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"I know I'm supposed to cut something, but what? And where?"
Lisa Simpson,Hey! The incision in the coronary artery must be made below the blockage. Below!
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Thanks, little girl."
Dr. Nick Riviera,THE KNEE BONE'S CONNECTED TO THE... SOMETHING. / THE SOMETHING'S CONNECTED TO THE... RED THING. / THE RED THING'S CONNECTED TO MY... WRISTWATCH... UH-OH.
,
Dr. Nick Riviera,Good news! The operation was a complete success.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that's wonderful!"
Angry Man,Dr. Nick Riviera. Remember me?
Dr. Nick Riviera,Well if it isn't my old friend Mr. McGreg -- with a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg.
,
Lisa Simpson,"All right, Dad!"
Bart Simpson,You rule intensive care!
,
Homer Simpson,Yabba dabba doo!
Homer Simpson,"SIMPSON, HOMER SIMPSON / HE'S THE GREATEST GUY IN HISTORY / FROM THE TOWN OF SPRINGFIELD / HE'S ABOUT TO HIT A CHESTNUT TREE"
,
Lenny Leonard,What do they do with these things after we seal 'em?
Carl Carlson,I hear they dump them in an abandoned chalk mine and cover 'em with cement.
Lenny Leonard,I hear they're sending 'em to one of those southern states where the governor's a crook.
Carl Carlson,Either way I'm sleepin' good tonight!
Waylon Smithers,"Well, sir, where shall we dump this batch -- the playground?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, all those bald children are arousing suspicion -- to the park!"
,
Waylon Smithers,"I think it's full, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's ridiculous, the last tree held nine drums."
Agent,"Agent Malone, Environmental Protection Agency. Some Boy Scouts stumbled on your little game of ""hide the ooze."""
,
Judge Snyder,"Mr. Burns, in light of your unbelievable contempt for human life, this court fines you three million dollars."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, my wallet's in my right front pocket."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, and uh, I'll take that statue of Justice too."
Judge Snyder,Sold!
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Andy Capp, you wife-beating drunk."
Marge Simpson,"Ohh, there's going to be a town meeting to decide how to spend Mr. Burns' money."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, what a boon it could be for our under-funded public schools."
,
Miss Hoover,"Children, it's time for your history lesson. Put on your virtual reality helmets."
Warrior,"Hm excellent. Hello, Lisa. I'm Genghis Khan. You'll go where I go. Defile what I defile. Eat who I eat. Hmm?"
Bart Simpson,"C'mon, Lis. We both know how this money should, nay, must be spent."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, we'll do anything you want. Just call off your giant mechanical ants!"
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Well, I think we should spend the money on something the whole town can be proud of."
Homer Simpson,"Like a giant billboard that says, ""No fat chicks""?"
Marge Simpson,No.
,
Marge Simpson,"Oooh, it looks like everyone in Springfield showed up for this."
,
Snake Jailbird,Could this town be any stupider?
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,Ordah! Please rise for the a Pledge of Allegiance.
Homer Simpson,Get to the money!
Mayor Joe Quimby,"In a moment. First, let's review the minutes from our last meeting..."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Get to the money!
Mayor Joe Quimby,Very well. We will now hear suggestions for the-a disbursement of the-a two million dollars.
Lisa Simpson,Don't you mean three million dollars?
Mayor Joe Quimby,Of course. How silly of me.
Maude Flanders,"Excuse me, we could use the money to hire firemen to finally put out that blaze on the east side of town."
Homer Simpson,Bo-ring!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello. My name is Mr. Snrub, and I come from... eh, someplace far away. Yes, that will do. Anyway, I-I say we invest that money back in the nuclear plant."
Waylon Smithers,I like the way Snrub thinks.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Pardon me, but I would like to see this money spent on more police officers. I have been shot eight times this year, and as a result I almost missed work."
Chief Wiggum,Crybaby.
Marge Simpson,My name is Marge Simpson and I have an idea. It may sound a little boring at first...
Mayor Joe Quimby,Chat away. I'll just amuse myself with some pornographic playing cards.
Marge Simpson,Well surely you've all noticed the terrible condition Main Street is in.
Marge Simpson,Many of us have destroyed it by leaving winter chains on our tires and carrying too much weight.
Homer Simpson,"Woo-hoo, look at that pavement fly!"
Marge Simpson,And those potholes are becoming a real nuisance.
Grampa Simpson,"Now hold on just one minute. Sure, we could fix up Main Street. We could put all our eggs in one basket..."
Grampa Simpson,"Shut up! I wasn't done yet. I'm just saying we could blow all our money on a stupid little street, but.."
Grampa Simpson,"I ain't fer it, I'm agin' it."
Crowd,Main Street! Main Street! Main Street!
Mayor Joe Quimby,"All those in favor of Grampa Simpsons' plan for re-building Main Street, please..."
LANLEY,"You know, a town with money's a little like the mule with a spinning wheel. No one knows how he got it and danged if he knows how to use it!"
Homer Simpson,Heh-heh... mule.
LANLEY,"The name's Lanley. Lyle Lanley. And I come before you good people tonight with an idea. Probably the greatest... Ah, it's not for you. It's more of a ""Shelbyville"" idea."
Mayor Joe Quimby,Now wait just a minute. We're twice as smart as the people of Shelbyville. Just tell us your idea and we'll vote for it.
LANLEY,All right. I tell you what I'll do. I'll show you my idea.
LANLEY,I give you the Springfield Monorail!
LANLEY,"I've sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville, and North Haverbrook and, by gum, it put them on the map!"
LANLEY,"Well, sir, there's nothing on earth like a genuine, bona-fide, electrified, six-car monorail. What'd I say?"
Ned Flanders,Monorail.
LANLEY,What's it called?
Selma Bouvier,Monorail!
LANLEY,"That's right, monorail!"
Miss Hoover,I hear those things are awfully loud.
LANLEY,It glides as softly as a cloud.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Is there a chance the track could bend?
LANLEY,"Not on your life, my Hindu friend."
Barney Gumble,What about us brain-dead slobs?
LANLEY,You'll be given cushy jobs.
Grampa Simpson,Were you sent here by the devil?
LANLEY,"No, good sir, I'm on the level."
Chief Wiggum,The ring came off my pudding can!
LANLEY,"Take my pen knife, my good man."
LANLEY,"I swear it's Springfield's only choice, throw up your hands and raise your voice."
Crowd,Monorail!
LANLEY,What's it called?
Crowd,Monorail!
LANLEY,Once again!
Crowd,Monorail!
Marge Simpson,But Main Street's still all cracked and broken.
Bart Simpson,"Sorry, Mom, the mob has spoken."
Crowd,MONORAIL / MONORAIL / MONORAIL!
Homer Simpson,Mono...
,
Bart Simpson,Monorail! Monorail! Monorail!
Marge Simpson,I still think we should have spent the money to fix Main Street.
Homer Simpson,"Well, you should have written a song like that guy."
Marge Simpson,
,
Miss Hoover,"Thank you for coming, Mr. Lanley. I'm Miss Hoover."
LANLEY,Miss Hoover? That is hard to believe.
Miss Hoover,"Oh, you."
LANLEY,"Now, I'm here to answer any questions you children may have about the monorail."
Ralph Wiggum,Can it outrun The Flash?
LANLEY,You bet.
Chuck,Can Superman outrun The Flash?
LANLEY,"Eh, sure, why not? Hello, little girl, wondering if your dolly can ride the monorail for free?"
Lisa Simpson,Hardly. I'd like you to explain why we should build a mass transit system in a small town with a centralized population.
LANLEY,"Ha, ha. Young lady, that's the most intelligent question I've ever been asked."
Lisa Simpson,Really?
Bart Simpson,"Wow, Dad. You really know your monorails."
LANLEY,"Oh, I could give you an answer, but the only ones who'd understand it would be you and me... And that includes your teacher."
Lisa Simpson,
LANLEY,"Next question -- You there, eating the paste."
,
Announcer,"Coming soon, it's ""Truckosaurus, the Movie"" starring Marlon Brando as the voice of John Truckosaurus."
Truckosaurus,You crazy car. I don't know whether to eat you or kiss you.
Announcer,Celebrity voice impersonated.
LANLEY,Are you stuck in a dead-end job?
Homer Simpson,Maybe.
LANLEY,Are you squandering the precious gift of life in front of the idiot box?
Homer Simpson,What's it to ya?
LANLEY,Are you on your third beer of the evening?
Homer Simpson,Does whiskey count as beer?
LANLEY,"Well, maybe it's time you joined the exciting field of Monorail Conducting by enrolling at the Lanley Institute."
Announcer,Actual institute may not match photo.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I want to be a monorail conductor."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, no..."
Homer Simpson,It's my life-long dream.
Marge Simpson,"Your life-long dream was to run out on the field during a baseball game, and you did it last year, remember?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah."
,
LANLEY,"Good evening. Before we begin, is anyone here an investigative reporter?"
Reporter,"I am, and.. she is."
LANLEY,"Well, I'd like you to please leave."
Reporter,Should we take our hidden camera?
LANLEY,Would you?
Reporter,"Let's go, Phil."
,
Bart Simpson,True or false: You can get mono from riding the monorail?
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, false... No, wait. Maybe it's true."
Bart Simpson,"No, you were right, it's ""false."" Wow, you really are gonna be a monorail conductor!"
Homer Simpson,"That's right, boy."
,
Bart Simpson,"You know, I used to think you were stuck in an emasculating, go-nowhere job."
Homer Simpson,Heh-heh. Kids.
Bart Simpson,"But now, I want to follow in your footsteps."
Homer Simpson,Do you want to change your name to Homer Junior? The kids can call you Hoju!
Bart Simpson,I'll get back to you.
,
Barney Gumble,"Come on... keep it comin'... over... over... mmm hmm... mmm hmm... Hi, Homer!"
Barney Gumble,I hate that sound.
,
Marge Simpson,"According to this book, the monorail goes over a hundred and fifty miles an hour. What if something goes wrong?"
Homer Simpson,"""What if?"" What if I'm taking a shower and I slip on a bar of soap? Oh, my God, I'd be killed!"
Marge Simpson,It frightens me that you want to work on something that's so unsafe.
Homer Simpson,We monorail conductors are a crazy breed. Half in love with death -- gobbling up danger like ordinary men eat peanuts... Am I turning you on?
Marge Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,What if I undo this button?
Marge Simpson,"Goodnight, Homer."
Homer Simpson,What if I talk like this?
Homer Simpson,What if I SING TO YOU? I GAVE MY LOVE A CHICKEN THAT HAD NO BONE/ Mmmm chicken.
,
LANLEY,"...so then, ""mono"" means ""one"" and ""rail"" means ""rail."" And that concludes our intensive three-week course."
Otto Mann,"Hey, wait, man. Who gets to be conductor?"
LANLEY,"Oh, right, that. Well, I've been monitoring your progress closely..."
LANLEY,But this gentleman here clearly stands out above the rest.
Homer Simpson,"Who, me?"
LANLEY,"Yeah, sure."
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!
Kent Brockman,"After an exhaustive search, Springfield has found its monorail conductor -- Homer Simpson."
,
Homer Simpson,"And this is the snack holder where I can put my beverage -- or, if you will -- cupcake."
Homer Simpson,THE WICKED WITCH.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, there's a family of opossums in here!"
Homer Simpson,I call the big one Bitey.
Marge Simpson,I'm going to see Mr. Lanley.
,
Marge Simpson,Mr. Lanley? Mr. Lanley?
,
LANLEY,How much did you see?
Marge Simpson,Nothing incriminating.
LANLEY,Good.
Marge Simpson,"Well, bye."
LANLEY,I don't know why I leave this lying around.
,
LANLEY,"I've sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville and North Haverbrook."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Is there a chance the track could bend?
Homer Simpson,I call the big one Bitey.
LANLEY,"I've sold momorails to Brockway, Odgenville and North Haverbrook."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Is there a chance the track could bend.
Homer Simpson,I call the big one Bitey.
,
Waitress,Go away! There ain't no monorail and there never was!
Sebastian Kobb,"Excuse me, Miss, you asked about the monorail?"
Marge Simpson,Who are you?
Sebastian Kobb,My name is Sebastian Kobb. Lanley hired me to build his monorail. He cut corners everywhere... bad wiring... faulty brakes... and the celebrity on the maiden voyage was Gallagher.
Sebastian Kobb,This is all that's left of one of the crappiest trains ever built.
Marge Simpson,"Mr. Kobb, what can we do?"
Sebastian Kobb,You just better have a damn good conductor.
,
Homer Simpson,I locked my keys in there. Get a rock.
,
Kent Brockman,"Ladies and gentlemen, nothing brings out the stars like the maiden voyage of a monorail. Everyone's here, from recently outed leading man, Dash Calhoun... to Krusty the Clown!"
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, Hey."
Woman With Baby,"Krusty, why won't you answer my calls? You've never even seen our son!"
Baby,
Marge Simpson,Homer.
Kent Brockman,"Here's one of those loveable high-schoolers from TV's Springfield Heights, 90210. He's cool, he's sexy, he's thirty-four years old, let's hear it for Kyle Darren!"
Kent Brockman,"And here's country singing sensation, Lurleen Lumpkin, fresh from her latest stay at the Betty Ford clinic!"
Kent Brockman,What ya been up to Lurleen?
Lurleen Lumpkin,I spent last night in a ditch.
Kent Brockman,"How about that, folks?"
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Now, I'd like to turn things over to our Grand Marshal, Mr. Leonard Nimoy."
NIMOY,
NIMOY,I'd say this vessel could do at least warp five.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"And let me say, ""May the force be with you."""
NIMOY,Do you even know who I am?
Mayor Joe Quimby,I think I do. Weren't you one of the Little Rascals?
,
Lisa Simpson,Mr. Lanley! Aren't you gonna ride the monorail?
LANLEY,"Little lady, I'd love to. But I have to catch a plane."
Lisa Simpson,But the ride only takes a minute.
LANLEY,"Yeah, well my plane leaves in less than one minute."
LANLEY,His car SCREECHES off.
,
,
Homer Simpson,All aboard!
,
,
Marge Simpson,We're too late!
Sebastian Kobb,I shouldn't have stopped for that haircut. Sorry.
,
NIMOY,"Actually, you see the doors on Star Trek were not mechanical. We had a stagehand on either side who would pull the door open when he saw you approach."
Man,Uh-huh.
,
Homer Simpson,"Stick your head out the window, boy. It's the greatest!"
Bart Simpson,Yee-hawww!
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Can't you stop it, Dad?"
Homer Simpson,I'm trying my best.
Woman,The lever you have pulled -- brakes -- is not in service. Please make a note of it.
,
Marge Simpson,How fast are they going?
Homer Simpson,
Sebastian Kobb,"Well, judging by your husband's cowardly scream, 180 miles an hour."
Homer Simpson,
,
Chief Wiggum,Ahhh. It's making me dizzy. I'm gonna take a nap.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"All right, I'm in charge here."
Chief Wiggum,"Ah, run along, Quimby. I think they're dedicating a phone booth somewhere."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Watch it, you talking tub of donut batter."
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, I got pictures of you, Quimby!"
Mayor Joe Quimby,"You don't scare me. That could be anyone's ass. Now, beat it. I'm calling the shots."
Chief Wiggum,"I think that sash is cutting off the air to your brain. The town charter says in an emergency, I run the show."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Well, we'll just see about that. Let's go to town hall."
Chief Wiggum,"Fine. Should we take one car, or should I follow you?"
,
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, according to the charter, as Chief Constable I'm supposed to get a pig every month ""... and two comely lasses of virtue true."""
Mayor Joe Quimby,Keep the pig. How many broads do I get?
Chief Wiggum,"Hey. Hey, hey, let go! You're rippin' it."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"No, you are."
Chief Wiggum,"No, you are."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Let go, that's the charter."

Engineer #1,"Wait a minute, we can just shut off the power!"
Engineer #2,"No such luck, it's solar powered."
Engineer #1,Solar power. When will people learn?

NIMOY,A solar eclipse. The cosmic ballet goes on.
Man,Does anyone wanna switch seats?
Homer Simpson,I did it!
,

Homer Simpson,
Captain,"Folks, this is your captain speaking. Our nonstop flight to Tahiti will be making a brief layover in North Haverbrook."
LANLEY,"North Haverbrook? Where have I heard that name before? Oh, no. Oh, no!"

Haverbrook Man,There he is! Seat 3-F.
,
,
Krusty the Clown,Krusty wants out!
NIMOY,No. The world needs laughter.

Homer Simpson,"Are we gonna die, son?"
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but at least we'll take a lot of innocent people with us."
Marge Simpson,Homer? Homer?
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, there's a man here who thinks he can help you."
Homer Simpson,Batman?
Marge Simpson,"No, he's a scientist."
Homer Simpson,Batman's a scientist.
Marge Simpson,It's not Batman!
Sebastian Kobb,I think I have a way to stop the train. You need to find an anchor of some sort.
,
Bart Anchor,"Think harder, Homer."
,
Homer Simpson,I'll take that.
,
Bart Simpson,Uh... Dad?
,
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Now separating Siamese Twins is a long and costly procedure.
,
Captain Horatio McCallister,Arr. Ye call that an anchor?
,
,
Homer Simpson,Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?
Bart Simpson,"Dad, you're a hero!"
Homer Simpson,"Yes, son. I'm the best mono-thingy guy there ever was."
,
NIMOY,"Well, my work is done here."
Barney Gumble,"Whadaya mean, your work is done? You didn't do anything."
NIMOY,Didn't I?
,
Marge Simpson,And that was the only folly the people of Springfield ever embarked upon -- except for the Popsicle stick skyscraper... and the fifty foot magnifying glass... and that escalator to nowhere.

Lisa Simpson,Yayyy!
Homer Simpson,"Now, what do we say when we get to the ticket booth?"
Lisa Simpson,We're under six!
Homer Simpson,"And I'm a college student! Heh, heh."
Marge Simpson,"Kids, I have some bad news. Your Great Aunt Gladys has... passed on."
Bart Simpson,"Gladys, Gladys... `bout yay high, blue hair, big dent in her forehead?"
Marge Simpson,"No honey, Gladys looked more like your Aunt Patty."
Bart Simpson,"Oh yeah, there she is."
Marge Simpson,The funeral's in Little Neck Falls. Looks like we'll have to go to Duff Gardens another time.
Lisa Simpson,We understand.
Bart Simpson,No use complaining about something you can't change.

Bart Simpson,ON TOP OF SPAGHETTI... ALL COVERED WITH CHEESE... I LOST MY POOR MEATBALL...
Marge Simpson,If you don't mind! We're on our way to a funeral.
Homer Simpson,"Ding-dong, the witch is dead."
Bart Simpson,WHICH OLD WITCH?
Homer Simpson,Patty. Selma. I'm sorry.
Selma Bouvier,He's hugging us. What do we do?
Patty Bouvier,Just close your eyes and think of MacGyver.
Bart Simpson,"Hey Homer, this luggage is crushing me."
Homer Simpson,Hey you don't hear Lisa complaining.
,
,
Selma Bouvier,I can't believe Auntie Gladys is really gone.
Patty Bouvier,Her legend will live forever.
Homer's Thought Bubble,"Yeah, the legend of the dog-faced woman!"
Homer Simpson,"Legend of the dog-faced woman! Oh, that's good."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's very rude of you."
Homer Simpson,What?
Selma Bouvier,Could we please stop somewhere? My butt's asleep.
,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I'm almost there."
Waitress,"Another placemat, sir?"
Homer Simpson,Please.
Marge Simpson,"While we're waiting for our pie, let's take a minute to remember Great Aunt Gladys."
Marge Simpson,"Wait a minute. That was ""Prince of Tides."""

Lisa Simpson,Five... six... seven... eight...
Marge Simpson,What are you kids playing?
Bart Simpson,Counting game.
Marge Simpson,That's nice.
Lisa Simpson,... Nine... ten...
,
Reverend,He was a good man. He was a kind man. He gave to his community and asked little in return. He never...
Reverend,"That's a woman? Dear Lord. Well, I guess most of what I said can be salvaged."
Patty Bouvier,"Take a seat, bozo. And that ""eulogy"" better not show up on the bill."
Patty Bouvier,I'll keep this short. Gladys lived alone. Died alone. I guess you could say she was a role model for Selma and me. She wasn't a rich woman... but she was rich in spirit.
Man,Forgot my hat.
,
Selma Bouvier,"Patty, I want a baby."
Homer Simpson,"Don't hassle the dead, boy. They have eerie powers."
Bart Simpson,Eh.
Homer Simpson,"It's just not fair, dammit!"

Lionel Hutz,"I'm Lionel Hutz, executor of Ms. Bouvier's estate. She left a video will, so I earn my fee simply by pressing this ""Play"" button. Pretty sweet, eh?"
Aunt Gladys,"I would like to start by reading a passage from Robert Frost. ""Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and..."
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,All in favor of skipping the poem?
Homer Simpson,Thank you.
Aunt Gladys,"And that has made all the difference... Now, let's get down to business."
HUTZ' VOICE,"To my executor, Lionel Hutz, I leave fifty thousand dollars."
Marge Simpson,Mr. Hutz!
MR. HUTZ,You'd be surprised how often that works. You really would!
Aunt Gladys,"To Marge, I leave my collection of potato chips that resemble celebrities. They're all here. Otto Von Bismarck. Maurice Chevalier. Right up to Jay Leno."
Aunt Gladys,"These chips were my children, Marjorie. Take special care of them."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, oh."
Aunt Gladys,"To my sister Jackie, I leave my pet iguana, Jubjub."
Jacqueline Bouvier,Why didn't she just leave me the bowel obstruction that killed her?
Aunt Gladys,"To my dear, childless nieces, Patty and Selma, I leave my grandfather clock and these words: Don't die lonely, like me. Raise a family. And do it now. Now. Now! Now! NOW!"
Patty Bouvier,"Hey, a grandfather clock, not bad."

Selma Bouvier,Orange is really your color.
Bag Boy,They make us wear this.
Selma Bouvier,Shall we continue this conversation over dinner?
Bag Boy,Uh... I'm not allowed to date customers... it's store policy.
Cashier,No it isn't.
Cashier,Ow.
Bag Boy,"Shut up, Arnold."
Cashier,"No, go for it, man."

Selma Bouvier,Yeah. I was so depressed I ate a jar of expired olives. I guess I'll never have a baby.
Lisa Simpson,"Aunt Selma, this may be presumptuous, but have you ever considered artificial insemination?"
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I don't know. You gotta be pretty desperate to make it with a robot."
Homer Simpson,I knew that.

Selma Bouvier,How do I know I'm getting quality?

Marge Simpson,Oh. Are you sure you wanna have a baby this way?
Patty Bouvier,"Yeah, you've had some pretty bad experiences ordering out of catalogs. Remember that mail order husband?"
,
Selma Bouvier,Ooh! You look just like your picture.
Selma Bouvier,Sorry. My mind's made up. I wanna have a kid and this is the only way I can do it.

Rex,What? This is a travesty! Everyone knows I'm the best actor in this ridiculous school.

Miss Hoover,"That's absurd, Rex. Ralph won the part fair and square."
Chief Wiggum,"That's the signal. Take the boot off the car, boys."

Lenny Leonard,Dental Plan.
Marge Simpson,Lisa needs braces.
Carl Carlson,Bullseye!
Homer Simpson,Thanks a lot Carl. Now I've lost my train of thought.
Lenny Leonard,Dental Plan.
Marge Simpson,Lisa needs braces.
Lenny Leonard,Dental Plan.
Marge Simpson,Lisa needs braces.
Homer Simpson,"If we give up our dental plan, I'll have to pay for Lisa's braces."
Homer Simpson,"People stop! We can't give up our dental plan! Lenny, without the dental plan, you wouldn't have that diamond in your tooth."
Guy,Yoink!
Lenny Leonard,Hey!
Homer Simpson,"And Gummy Joe, where would you be without the dental plan?"
Gummy Joe,"I wouldn't have old chomper here, that's for sure."
Homer Simpson,You know what I think of this contract?

C. Montgomery Burns,"Who is that firebrand, Smithers?"
Waylon Smithers,"That's Homer Simpson, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh?... New man?"
Waylon Smithers,"Actually sir, he thwarted your campaign for governor... you ran over his son... he saved the plant from meltdown and his wife painted your portrait--"
C. Montgomery Burns,Doesn't ring a bell.
,
Workers,Homer! Homer! Homer!
Carl Carlson,I move that Homer Simpson be our new union president. All in favor...
Crowd,Aye!
Carl Carlson,All opposed?
Man,Nay.
Carl Carlson,"Congratulations, Homer!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what does this job pay?"
Carl Carlson,Nothin'.
Homer Simpson,
Carl Carlson,... Unless you're crooked.
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
,
Marge Simpson,"President of the union! I'm so proud of you, Homie."
Lisa Simpson,This is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man.
Homer Simpson,And make life-long connections to the world of Organized Crime. Hmmm... organized crime.
Donut Vendor,"Don Homer, I have baked a special donut just for you."
Homer Simpson,Mmm. Gratzi.
Woman,"Don Homer, my son, he has trouble with the..."
Homer Simpson,Eh-Eh-Eh.
Homer Simpson,Molto bene.
Homer Simpson,That's-a-nice-a-donut.
Lisa Simpson,Do you think you can get the dental plan back?
Homer Simpson,"Well, that depends on who's a better negotiator, Mr. Burns or me."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I'll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol' danish."
Homer Simpson,"Done and done! Heh, heh, heh."
,
Dr. Wolfe,"Lisa and Marge, these braces are invisible, painless, and periodically release a delightful burst of Calvin Klein's Obsession for teeth."
Lisa Simpson,Mmmm.
Marge Simpson,"Doctor, we don't have a dental plan right now. So we'll need something a little more... affordable."
Dr. Wolfe,These pre-date stainless steel so you can't get them wet.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm, he's a worthy foe. Look at him, Smithers. Exercising away while the others are off at the candy machine."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Lenny, can you get this Sugar Daddy off my back?"
Lenny Leonard,"Okay, but it's the last time."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"We don't have to be adversaries, Homer. We both want a fair union contract."
C. Montgomery Burns,"And, if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I mean, if I should slip something into your pocket, what's the harm?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"After all, negotiations make strange bedfellows."
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I'm flattered... maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no."
,
Dr. Wolfe,"Lisa, so you won't be scared, I'll show you some of the tools I'll be using."
Dr. Wolfe,This is the scraper. This is the poker. And this happy little fellow is the gouger.
Lisa Simpson,Uh huh.
Dr. Wolfe,"Now, the first thing I'll be doing is chiseling some teeth out of your jaw- bone. Hold still while I gas you."
Mop Top #1,Look fellas! It's Lisa in the sky.
Mop Top #2,"No diamonds, though."
Mop Top #3,Look out for that campy drawing of Queen Victoria!
Mop Tops,"For the love of God, help us!"
Lisa Simpson,The mirror. The mirror!
,
Marge Simpson,"Honey, you look fine."
Homer Simpson,Who is it?
Goon,Goons.
Homer Simpson,Who?
Goon,Hired goons.
Homer Simpson,Hired goons?
,
Bird,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Homer! I hope Crusher and Low Blow didn't hurt you."
Homer Simpson,"You know, you could have just called me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh yes, but the telephone is so impersonal. I prefer the hands-on touch you only get with hired goons."
Homer Simpson,Hired goons?
C. Montgomery Burns,This is the largest TV in the free world.
Bumblebee Man,Aiiee! Un gato malodoro!
C. Montgomery Burns,
C. Montgomery Burns,This is a thousand monkeys working at a thousand typewriters. Soon they'll have written the greatest novel known to man.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Let's see. ""It was the best of times. It was the blurst of times?"" You stupid monkey!"
Monkey,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ohh, shut up."
C. Montgomery Burns,And this is my basement.
Homer Simpson,"Gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, I really should stop ending the tour with it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, let's get down to business."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, Homer, I know what you're thinking and I want to take the pressure off."
C. Montgomery Burns,"It doesn't take a whiz to see that you're looking out for number one. Well, listen to me and you'll make a big splash very soon."
Homer Simpson,Which way to the bathroom?
C. Montgomery Burns,Oh. It's the twenty-third door on the left.
Homer Simpson,Nope. Nope. Nope.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, he wouldn't even hear me out."
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,Find the bathroom alright?
Homer Simpson,Uh... yeah.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, you've won this round Simpson, but I'll grind you into the earth like a bug!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, be a dear and rub my legs till the feeling comes back."
C. Montgomery Burns,"A bug, I tell you! A bug!"
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna resign. I don't know why they made me Union President in the first place.
Marge Simpson,Because they love you down at the plant.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you're right. Guys are always patting my bald head for luck... pinching my belly to hear my girlish laugh..."
Marge Simpson,That doesn't sound like they like you at all.
Homer Simpson,"Ya know, I think you're right. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm gonna punch Lenny in the back of the head."

Seymour Skinner,"Batten down those cowlicks... straighten that part... uncross those eyes, Mister."

Photographer,"Come on, honey, smile."
Photographer,I bet you've got a beautiful smile. Why don't you share it with the world?
Photographer,"We can always stick in a ""Photo Not Available"" card."

Homer Simpson,"Fellow workers, I've been meeting with Mr. Burns day and night and I've had enough."
Workers,Strike! Strike! Strike!
Carl Carlson,All in favor of a strike...

C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, get me some strike breakers like the kind they had in the 30's."
,
Grampa Simpson,"We can't bust heads like we used to, but we have our ways."
Grampa Simpson,"One trick is to tell them stories that don't go anywhere... Like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time... now to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days nickels had pictures of bumblebees on them. ""Give me five bees for a quarter"" you'd say. Now, where were we? Oh yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions, because of the war..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Full power, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,
,
Lisa Simpson,SO WE'LL MARCH DAY AND NIGHT / BY THE BIG COOLING TOWER / THEY HAVE THE PLANT / BUT WE HAVE THE POWER.
Lenny Leonard,"Now do ""Classical Gas."""

DR. JOYCE,I brought my own mike!
Kent Brockman,"Yes, well, Homer, organized labor has been called a lumbering dinosaur."
Homer Simpson,
Kent Brockman,"Yes, well, my director is telling me not to talk to you anymore."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Kent Brockman,"Uh, Mr. Burns, you mentioned you wanted an opening tirade?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, thank you, Kent. Fifteen minutes from now I will wreak a terrible vengeance on this city. No one will be spared. No one!"
Kent Brockman,"A chilling vision of things to come. Homer, any thoughts?"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Oh for God's sake.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Goodbye, Springfield. From hell's heart I stab at thee!"

Lisa Simpson,SO WE'LL MARCH DAY AND NIGHT /

C. Montgomery Burns,"Look at them all, through the darkness I'm bringing. They're not sad at all, they're actually singing! They sing without juicers! They sing without blenders! They sing without flunjers, capdabblers and smendlers! Tell Simpson I'm ready to deal"
C. Montgomery Burns,All right! You can even have the dental plan!... On one condition. You must resign as head of the union.
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm beginning to think that Homer Simpson was not the brilliant tactician I thought he was."
Homer Simpson,"Woop, woop, woop! Woop, woop, woop!"
,
Homer Simpson,We're going back to work!
,
,
,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, honey, you can hardly see your new braces."
Lisa Simpson,And that's the tooth!
Dr. Wolfe,Oops. I left the gas on.

Bart Simpson,"Oh no, I can't see! I'm blind! Blind!"
Homer Simpson,Haw haw. April Fool's.
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Haw, haw. April Fool's! I've been keepin' that carton of milk next to the furnace for six weeks! Sucker!"
Bart Simpson,"You're goin' down, Homer! I'm gonna fool you!"
Homer Simpson,You talk better than you fool.
Bart Simpson,I'll fool you up real nice!
Homer Simpson,You couldn't fool your mother on the foolingest day of your life if you had an electrified fooling machine.
Marge Simpson,P.U.
Homer Simpson,"Ahhh, what noble visionary thought up April Fool's Day?"
Lisa Simpson,"Like Halloween and Christmas, April Fool's Day traces its origins to pagan ritual."
Homer Simpson,God bless those pagans.
Lisa Simpson,April first used to be the Pagan New Year.
,
Pagan Simpsons,Blood for Baal! Blood for Baal!
Lisa Simpson,The Christians changed their calendar and ridiculed those who didn't.
Homer Simpson,Happy New Year!
Ned Flanders,"Hi-ho pagans! New Years was three months ago, but here's a present anyhoo!"
Todd Flanders,It's ram's blood for your Godless ceremony!
Ned Flanders,April Fool's!
Flanders Family,
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Now who's laughing? Now who's laughing?
,
Homer Simpson,And that's the story of April Fool's Day.
Lisa Simpson,Dad! I was telling the story.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right."
,
Captain Horatio McCallister,Thar she blows! The catch of the day!
Waiters/cooks,"Arrrr, harrrr, harrrrrr!"
Captain Horatio McCallister,"Why, ye mutinous dogs. From this day, I be requirin' hair nets!"
Waiters/cooks,Arrrr... arrrrrr.... arrrrrr....
,
Bart Simpson,I've got to fool him before the day is out -- but how? He must have a weakness.
Homer Simpson,"Ah, beer. My one weakness. My Achilles heel, if you will."
Bart Simpson,Beer! Beer is the cheese. But how to use it...
Homer Simpson,"Whew! It's a good thing that beer wasn't shaken up any more, or I'd have looked quite the fool. An April Fool, as it were."
Bart Simpson,
,
Teenage Clerk,Hey kid. That's for customers only.
Bart Simpson,"Uh, did you know there's a guy outside handing out free Stridex pads?"
Teenage Clerk,"Wow, I'm in pizza-face paradise."
Bart Simpson,Moron.
,
Bumblebee Man,"Ay, no es bueno."
Homer Simpson,So thirsty... Eh. What're you gonna do?
Announcer,"The following is a public service announcement. Excess of alcohol consumption can cause liver damage, and cancer of the rectum."
Homer Simpson,Mmmm... beer.
Bart Simpson,April F...
,
Lou,That sounded like an explosion at the old Simpson place.
Chief Wiggum,Forget it. That's two blocks away.
Lou,It looks like there's beer coming out of the chimney.
Chief Wiggum,I'm proceeding on foot. Call in a Code eight.
Lou,We need pretzels! Repeat! Pretzels!

Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Mrs. Simpson, I'm afraid your husband is dead."
Marge Simpson,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,April Fool's! He's very much alive... although I'm afraid he may never walk again.

Specialist,"Homer has many, many horrible problems. These shadows are brain lesions resulting from numerous blows to the head... And his brain waves are disturbingly erratic."
,
Dr. Marvin Monroe,"...You are wired in to the rest of your family. You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock--"
Homer Simpson,Arrrgh!
Bart Simpson,Just testing.
Lisa Simpson,Arrrgh!
Marge Simpson,"Bart, how could you shock your little sister?"
Bart Simpson,My finger slipped.
Bart Simpson,Arrrgh!
Lisa Simpson,So did mine.
Marge Simpson,Bart! Lisa! Stop that.
Lisa Simpson,Arrrgh!
Homer Simpson,Arrrgh!
Lisa Simpson,Arrrgh!
Marge Simpson,Arrrgh!
Bart Simpson,Arrrgh!
Dr. Marvin Monroe,"No, no. No! No, wait a minute! Wait! Wait! Folks! Folks, if I could... Not yet! This is not the way to get healthy!"
,
,
Specialist,"Mrs. Simpson, can you think of anything to account for all this?"
Marge Simpson,I have no idea. Unless it was that time he kept falling down the cliff.
,
Bart Simpson,"I won't jump anymore, I promise."
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God."
Bart Simpson,"I love you, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right --"
Homer Simpson,I'm going to make it! I'm going to make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!! I--
Specialist,Hmm. That still wouldn't explain what I'm seeing here.
Marge Simpson,You look familiar. Have we met before?
,
,
Vet,Clear! Ugh... Clear!
Nurse,Doctor... he's gone.
Vet,This is the part of the job I hate.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,You're a veterinarian?
Specialist,That's right. And for an extra twenty dollars I'll give Homer a tick bath and then spay him.
Bart Simpson,"Here ya go, Doc."
Marge Simpson,Bart!
Bart Simpson,Shop around. You can't beat that price.
,
Homer Simpson,You guys must have been pretty worried about me.
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, we know you're tough, Dad. Remember that time you got lost in the forest?"
,
Homer Simpson,"This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy."
Homer Simpson,Shhhh! Just watch.
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him."
Bart Simpson,"Right, Dad."
Homer Simpson,Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!
Marge Simpson,It's true. You have good coping skills.
,
Homer Simpson,"The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly."
Bart Simpson,And there's one Itchy and Scratchy cartoon I don't think we'll ever forget.
Marge Simpson,Why'd you bring that up?
Bart Simpson,It was an amusing episode... of our lives.
Homer Simpson,"Thanks for coming to visit me, Moe."
Moe Szyslak,I brought you a little present.
Homer Simpson,No! No! Beer bring pain!
Barney Gumble,I can't stand to see him like this!
Moe Szyslak,He really needs a girlfriend.
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, what if I wind up as some vegetable, watching TV on the couch? My important work will never be completed."
Marge Simpson,"Society's loss, I suppose. But our marriage has been through hard times and we always pull through."
,
Homer Simpson,Marge!
,
Homer Simpson,"What a lovely surprise! You're here to see me, right?"
Marge Simpson,Of course.
Lenny Leonard,"Hey! Way to go, Homer. Way to go."
Another Worker,"Hey, what'll I tell the boss?"
Homer Simpson,Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman I love. And I won't be back for ten minutes.
,
Intern,"You can do it, Homer. Stand up."
Homer Simpson,I can't.
Intern,He just won't budge. I've tried everything. Nothing can reach him.
Homer Simpson,Mmm... chocolate.
,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Chocolate -- half price!
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, chocolate."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Can't breathe... sweet chocolate... cutting off air... ...Mmm, nuts."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah."
,
Grampa Simpson,Poor Homer. This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.
Grampa Simpson,Ahhh! Kill it! Kill it!
Marge Simpson,"Grampa, please. He's in a coma."
Grampa Simpson,"Coma? Why, I go in and out of comas all the... French toast, please."
Lisa Simpson,Is a coma painful?
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, heck, no! You relive long lost-summers, kiss girls from high school -- it's like one of those TV shows where they show a buncha clips from old episodes."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, well, anyway, I wonder what he's thinking now."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,This man is costing my health plan five thousand dollars a day. I demand that he die with dignity.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Now look, I'm the doctor here!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I demand a second opinion."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Hi, everybody!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hi, Dr. Nick!"
Homer Simpson,Oof.
Bart Simpson,And sometimes I got into trouble...
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Oh, dear. I see no signs of life. Just to be safe, we better pull the plug."
C. Montgomery Burns,Yoink.
Marge Simpson,"Mr. Burns, how can you be so cold- hearted?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"You have no idea, woman, what that man's put me through."
,
Homer Simpson,Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Please, do go on..."
Homer Simpson,I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, please, continue..."
Homer Simpson,I thought maybe you...
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, thanks for your time."
Professor Jonathan Frink,"I have an unorthodox solution: a ""fantastic voyage"", if you will. Three scientists... One a beautiful woman... will be shrunk to microscopic size. They will then rendezvous in Mr. Simpson's lower colon --"
Lisa Simpson,Eww.
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Well, we have had a little trouble finding volunteers..."
,
Lisa Simpson,"I wish I'd gotten to know you better, Dad. But there were times when we really connected."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Dad. Want me to cut out this infernal racket?"
Homer Simpson,No. Let me hear you play.
Lisa Simpson,Why?
Homer Simpson,"Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's more like it! ""OH, I WANT TO BE IN THAT RUMBA / WHEN THE SAINTS GO OVER THERE.... OVER THERE..."
Homer Simpson,"OVER THERE."""
Lisa Simpson,"I wrote this for you, Dad."
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I'm so sorry. I know I haven't been a perfect kid..."

Homer Simpson,Why you little...
Homer Simpson,What the...
Bart Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,I know that I got you mad once in a while...
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, you can't go on like this."
Bart Simpson,I know.
Bart Simpson,...but you always looked out for me.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys?"
Homer Simpson,They're fine.
Bart Simpson,"And no matter what happens, I'll never forget the advice you gave me."
,
Homer Simpson,"Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave."
,
Homer Simpson,"...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave."
Homer Simpson,Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that's how we shave.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, it's all my fault! I shook up that can of beer!"
Bart Simpson,It was just an April Fool's joke.
Homer Simpson,"Why, you little --"
Marge Simpson,Homie! You're all right!
Lisa Simpson,We're a family again!
,
Homer Simpson,This calls for a celebration. We're all going to Hawaii!
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Gotcha! It's April Fool's for two more minutes!
Bart Simpson,"Dad, it's May 16th."
Lisa Simpson,You were in that coma for seven weeks.
Marge Simpson,Uh-huh.
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,You lost five percent of your brain.
Homer Simpson,Me lose brain? Uh-oh.
Homer Simpson,Why'd I laugh?
,
Krusty the Clown,Mmm. Delicious.
Chef,"Now, Krusty, I hear it's your birthday, so I got your mother's recipe for matzoh brei."
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, I don't do the Jewish stuff on the air."
Chef,"But Herschel, bubbeleh --"
Krusty the Clown,Ix-nay on the Ew-Jay! Roll the cartoon.
,
Lisa Simpson,It's so sad that Krusty is ashamed of his roots.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it happened again!"
Bart Simpson,What are you gonna change your name to when you grow up?
Lisa Simpson,Lois Sanborn.
Bart Simpson,Steve Bennett.
Scratchy,Ow.
Itchy,"He, he, he."
Scratchy,Ow.
Itchy,"He, he, he."
Scratchy,Ow.
Itchy,"He, he, he."
Lisa Simpson,This is a rather lifeless outing.
Bart Simpson,Don't worry. They're building to something.
Scratchy,Ow.
Itchy,"He, he, he."
Scratchy,"Kids, say no to drugs."
,
Krusty the Clown,"I could pull a better cartoon out of my A... Hey, whoa! Wasn't that great, kids?"
,
Lisa Simpson,That's as bad as the tasteless Itchy and Sambo cartoons of the late 30s. The writers should be ashamed of themselves.
Bart Simpson,Cartoons have writers?
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, sort of."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah, well you and I could write a better cartoon than that."
Lisa Simpson,"Write a cartoon ourselves? Bart, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Bart Simpson,Probably not.
Bart Simpson,Lie in the snow and count to sixty.
Bart Simpson,"Giddiyup! Merry Christmas, suckers."
Marge Simpson,"""Third Notice,"" ""Final Notice,"" ""Some Guys are Coming.""... Ooh, what's this?"
Marge Simpson,An invitation to our High School Reunion.
Marge Simpson,"Gee, that's odd. They didn't send one to you."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I ate those fancy soaps you bought for the bathroom."
Marge Simpson,Oh my God.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I never graduated from high school."
Marge Simpson,"Well that still doesn't explain why you ate my soap. Wait, maybe it does."
Homer Simpson,"I never passed remedial science one ""A""."
Marge Simpson,And you're a nuclear technician?
Homer Simpson,"Marge, ixnay on the uclear-nay ecnitian-tay."
Marge Simpson,What did you way?
Homer Simpson,"I don't know. I flunked Latin, too."
Lisa Simpson,"According to this book, the first thing we need is a setting."
Bart Simpson,Okay... setting... setting... setting... setting...
Bart Simpson,How about a barber shop?
Lisa Simpson,Great.
,
Lisa Simpson,Scratchy is getting a haircut. Then Itchy -- the barber -- chops Scratchy's head off with a razor!
Bart Simpson,"Eh, too predictable. The way I see it, instead of shampoo Itchy covers Scratchy's hair with barbecue sauce... opens a box of flesh-eating ants... and the rest writes itself."
Elvis,"Eh, this show ain't no good."
Lisa Simpson,Finished. Now all we have to do is put our names on it.
Bart Simpson,Fine. Put my name first.
Lisa Simpson,No way.
Bart Simpson,"All right, then to decide it, I propose a race around the world. Meet me at Luster Square at noon tomorrow. The queen herself shall drop the checkered flag."
Lisa Simpson,"Look there's only one reasonable way to settle this: rock, paper, scissors."
Bart Simpson,Rock.
Lisa Simpson,Paper.
Bart Simpson,

Grampa Simpson,"""Ishy and Wha?"" Uh, you must be some kind of crazy person!"
Ned Flanders,"Okely, dokely do!"
Bart's Thoughts,Good ol' rock. Nothing beats that.
Lisa's Thoughts,Poor predictable Bart. Always takes rock.
Writer,Fair Harvard I
Writer,"You, sir, have the boorish manners of a Yalie."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, they rejected our script."
Bart Simpson,I guess we're just not cut out to be writers.
Lisa Simpson,Maybe he just doesn't take us seriously 'cause we're kids. Let's put a grownup's name on it.
Bart Simpson,"Well, how about Grampa? He's pretty out of it. He let those guys use his check book for a whole year."
,
,
Grampa Simpson,"... when I read your magazine I don't see one wrinkled face or a single toothless grin. For shame! To the sickos at ""Modern Bride"" magazine."
Bart Simpson,"Hey Grampa, we need to know your first name."
Grampa Simpson,You're making my tombstone!
Lisa Simpson,"No, we're just curious."
Grampa Simpson,"All right, let's see. First name... first name... well, whenever I'm confused, I just check my underwear. It holds the answer to all the important questions."
Grampa Simpson,Call me... Abraham Simpson!
Lisa Simpson,"Grampa, how'd you take off your underwear without taking off your pants?"
Grampa Simpson,I don't know.
,
Writer,"Sir, you locked my office, and I wanted to get my Harvard mug."
,
Orderly,"Phone call, Simpson."
Grampa Simpson,Beh?
Roxie,"Is this the Abraham Simpson who wrote the ""Itchy and Scratchy"" episode?"
Roxie,"I'm sorry, but we have a substantial check here for a Mr. Abraham Simpson."
Grampa Simpson,"That's right, I did the Iggy."
,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, my high school yearbook..."
Homer Simpson,You handsome devil.
Homer Simpson,I can't believe I ate the whole thing.
Homer Simpson,"""Activities, none. Sports, none. Honors, none."" So many memories."
Marge Simpson,Time to go to the reunion.
Homer Simpson,"It'll be great to see the old gang again... Potsy, Ralph Malph, ""The Fonz""..."
Marge Simpson,"That was ""Happy Days."""
Homer Simpson,"No, they weren't all happy Days. Like the time Pinky Tuscadero crashed her motorcycle -- or the night I lost all my money to those card sharks, and my Dad, Tom Bosley, had to get it back."
Marge Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Hello, Principal Dondelinger."
Principal Dondelinger,"Marge Bouvier, it's so good to see you."
Principal Dondelinger,"Sorry, sir. We're not letting vagrants sleep in the gym tonight. But we will be putting some scraps by the back door."
Homer Simpson,
Principal Dondelinger,"Oh, it's you Simpson."
Homer Simpson,"Look, there's Bobby Mindich, the class clown."
Bobby Mindich,I am not a crook.
Homer Simpson,Richard Nixon.
Marge Simpson,I know.
,
Marge Simpson,"Oh my God, it's my old boyfriend, Artie Ziff."
ARTIE,"Hello, Marge. Have you heard? I'm stinking rich."
ARTIE,Jealous?
Homer Simpson,I'll bet you'd trade it all for one night with my wife.
ARTIE,I would.
Homer Simpson,Hmmm.
Marge Simpson,Homer!
,
Bobby Mindich,"Hey, man. It's Dave. Open up man. Dave's not here, man."
Homer Simpson,
